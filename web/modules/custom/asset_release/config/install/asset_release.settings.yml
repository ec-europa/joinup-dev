# The array of allowed conditions for the asset release workflow transitions.
# Format of array:
# @code
# [
#   <target state> => [
#     <source state> => [
#       <role1>
#       <role2>
#       .
#       .
#     ]
#   ]
# ]
# @endcode
#
# The array is a three dimensions array. The first level is the
# target state. Each target state is an array of allowed source
# states which in every check, is the current state of the entity.
# Finally, the source states are arrays of roles that are allowed to
# perform this action.
#
# The reverse indexing here (source states
# keyed by the target state) is to follow the state_machines module logic
# of indexing states.
