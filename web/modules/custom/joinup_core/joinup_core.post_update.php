 * Post update functions for Joinup.

 * This should only contain update functions that rely on the Drupal API but
 * need to run _before_ the configuration is imported.
 *
 * For example this can be used to enable a new module that needs to have its
 * code available for the configuration to be successfully imported or updated.
 *
 * In most cases though update code should be placed in joinup_core.deploy.php.
