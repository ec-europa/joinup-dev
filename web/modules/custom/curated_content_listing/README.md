Curated content listing
=======================

Curated content listings are lists of hand picked content that are managed by
moderators. Examples of these are the 'In the spotlight' and 'Highlighted
solution' sections on the homepage.

The listings are fully handled using the Entityqueue module. This module
customizes the entity queue functionality to fit the desired Joinup UX.
