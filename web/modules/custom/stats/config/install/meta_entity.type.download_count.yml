description: 'Download counts are for files and attachments. Typically the time period will be set to "All time" to get the complete download count since the site was launched.<br />The difference between "unique hits" and "hits" is that "unique hits" only count each download by a single visitor once. If a visitor downloads a file multiple times, it still only counts as 1 unique hit. This can be used to deter abuse by repeated downloads to artificially increase the download count.'
