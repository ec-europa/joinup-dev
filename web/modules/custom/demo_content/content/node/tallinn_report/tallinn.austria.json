A core register needs to be defined for natural and legal persons with the necessary attributes and optimal processes for entering and updating the data. Cleaning up, merging and synchronising registers should be drawn up on this basis. Updates must be made to be required by law to ensure that the register basis is kept current. Wherever data privacy allows, the transmission of data must be made legal and automated queries must be made possible. Standardised technical interfaces need to be created to be used for all registers. With the creation of these kinds of automated mechanisms, it should be a duty of the authorities to support queries to the register. This would remove the need for businesses and citizens to submit information which is already saved in central registers (e.g., Central Register of Residents). Since personal information in particular plays a central role for optimisation for many different procedures, implementing a Central Register of Civil Status (including Births, Marriages and Deaths) should be carried out quickly. This Central Register of Births, Marriages and Deaths would be the key to an optimal procedure flow with the focus on \"one-stop\".<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation has since formed the basis for a number of specific implementation measures, which contributes to a gradual improvement in the data inventory kept by the administration. Of pivotal importance in this context is particularly the register cores mentioned at the beginning for natural and non-natural persons whose functionality is firstly provided by the central civil status and nationality register (for natural persons) and secondly by the business register (for non-natural persons).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AT E-Government Act contains an explicit Provision (\u00a717 (2)) which foresees the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If authorities must determine the accuracy of data and the data is contained in a electronic register of public sector Controllers and the data subject has consented to the acquisition of the data or&nbsp;such acquisition through official channels is authorised by law, then authorities shall acquire the data themselves via electronic communications to the extent this is necessary.
