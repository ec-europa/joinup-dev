Expansion Panel
===============

Provides integration with the Material Design [Expansion panel][1] surface. The
module offers a field widget for entity reference fields. The information which
is shown in the expansion panel "content" (the expanded area) is configurable
through a view mode in the form settings. The "header" (the title which is shown
even when the panel is collapsed) is the title of the referenced entity.

This has been developed as a custom module because this depends heavily on the
current Joinup theme which is based on a customized legacy implementation of the
Material Design frontend framework. There is little value in making this a
contributed module because it is not usable outside of Joinup.
