 * Defines a cache context service for collection owners.

 * This cache context should be used in any render elements that have different
 * content when shown to a collection owner.
 *
 * Example use case: the collection overview has an additional "My collections"
 * facet that is shown only to collection owners.
 *
 * This is similar to OgRoleCacheContext but is much less granular, since we
 * only have a small number of collection owners as compared to members with
 * other roles.
 *
 * Since some users might own many collections the context key is presented as a
 * hashed value.
