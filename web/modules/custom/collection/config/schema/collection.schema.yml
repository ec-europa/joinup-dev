    # The array of allowed conditions for collection workflow transitions.
    # Format of array:
    # @code
    # [
    #   <target state> => [
    #     <source state> => [
    #       <role1>
    #       <role2>
    #       .
    #       .
    #     ]
    #   ]
    # ]
    # @endcode
    #
    # The array is a three dimensions array. The first level is the target state
    # the entity transits to. Each target state is an array of allowed source
    # states which in every check, is the current state of the entity. Finally,
    # the source states are arrays of roles that are allowed to perform this
    # action.
    #
    # The reverse indexing here (source states keyed by the target state) is to
    # follow the state_machines module logic of indexing states.
