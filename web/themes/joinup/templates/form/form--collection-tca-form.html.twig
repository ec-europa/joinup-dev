    <p>Joinup Collections are spaces where you can collaborate with others sharing your same interests around a certain domain, and contain all the contents of any kind related to that domain (solutions, news, newsletters and announcements of events and documents of various kinds).</p>

      <li>Add other people as moderators and owners of the Collection;</li>
      <li>Accept or reject users' proposal to add their solution your collection, based on relevance and <a href="/joinup/eligibility-criteria">eligibility criteria</a>;</li>
      <li>Remove members from your Collection;</li>
      <li>Moderate posts and comments in your Collection;</li>
      <li>Delete your Collection</li>
    </ul>
    What others can do when they join your Collection:
    <ul>

      <li>If there is already a collection with content similar to that which you intend to include;</li>
    </ul>
