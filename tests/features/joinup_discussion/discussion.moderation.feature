Feature: Discussion moderation
  In order to manage discussions
  As a user of the website
  I need to be able to transit the discussions from one state to another.

  Scenario: Publish, request changes, propose, publish again and archive a discussion.
    Given users:
      | name            |
      | Gabe Rogers     |
      | Brigham Salvage |
    And the following collection:
      | title               | DIY collection                           |
      | description         | Collection of "Do it yourself" projects. |
      | logo                | logo.png                                 |
      | elibrary creation   | facilitators                             |
      | state               | validated                                |
    And the following collection user membership:
