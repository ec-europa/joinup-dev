Feature: Solution homepage
  In order get an idea of what a solution is about
  As a user of the website
  I need to be able see an introduction of the solution on its homepage

  Scenario: The solution homepage shows basic information about the solution
    Given the following solution:
      | title       | Petri net  |
      | description | "<p>A <b>Petri net</b>, also known as a <b>place/transition (PT) net</b>, is one of several <a href=\"#mathematical\">mathematical</a> modeling languages for the description of distributed systems. It is a class of discrete event dynamic system. A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph, in which the nodes represent transitions (i.e. events that may occur, represented by bars) and places (i.e. conditions, represented by circles). The directed arcs describe which places are pre- and/or postconditions for which transitions (signified by arrows). Some sources state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri — at the age of 13 — for the purpose of describing chemical processes.</p>" |

    When I go to the homepage of the "Petri net" solution
    # Checking for HTML text ensures that any HTML elements in the abstract are correctly stripped.
    Then the page should contain the html text "A Petri net, also known as a place/transition (PT) net, is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems."
    # The text should be split on a word boundary after 500 characters, followed by an ellipsis.
    And the page should contain the html text "(signified by arrows)…"
    # There should be a link to the about page.
    And I should see the link "Read more"
    # The abstract itself should be stripped of unsightly links.
    But I should not see the link "mathematical"
    # The 'Read more' link leads to the About page.
    When I click "Read more"
    Then I should see the heading "About Petri net"

  # This is a regression test for the entities that include a hashmark on their Uri.
