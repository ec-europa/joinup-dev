  Scenario: The solution homepage shows related content.

    # I should see only the related release.
    Then I should see the "IS protocol paper 1" tile
    # And the distribution directly associated.
    And I should see the "Protocol draft" tile
    # Distribution associated to a release should not be shown.
    But I should not see the "PDF version" tile
    And I should not see the "ZIP version" tile
    # Unrelated content should not be shown.
    And I should not see the "Fireproof" tile
    And I should not see the "Code of conduct" tile
    # Nor the solution itself should be shown.
    And I should not see the "Information sharing protocol" tile

    # Test the filtering on the content type facet.
    When I click the Distribution content tab
    Then I should see the "Protocol draft" tile
    But I should not see the "IS protocol paper 1" tile

    # Reset the content type facet by clicking it again.
    When I click the Distribution content tab
    # Test the policy domain and spatial coverage inline facets.
    Then "all policy domains" should be selected in the "solution policy domain" inline facet
    And the "solution policy domain" inline facet should allow selecting the following values "E-inclusion (1), Statistics and Analysis (1)"
    And "everywhere" should be selected in the "solution spatial coverage" inline facet
    And the "solution spatial coverage" inline facet should allow selecting the following values "European Union (2), Belgium (1)"

    # Verify that the other solution is showing its related content.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Security audit tools" solution
    Then I should see the "Fireproof 0.1" tile
    #Then I should see the text "Fireproof 0.1"
    And I should see the "Code of conduct" tile
    But I should not see the "IS protocol paper 1" tile
    And I should not see the "Protocol draft" tile

  # This is a regression test for the entities that include a hashmark on their Uri.
  # @see https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-3225
  Scenario: Regression test for Uris that include a '#'.
    Given the following solution:
      | uri         | http://solution/example1/test#        |

  # Regression test to ensure that related community content does not appear in the draft view.
  # @see: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-3262
  Scenario: The related content should not be shown in the draft view version as part of the content.
    When I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Information sharing protocol" solution
    And I go to the homepage of the "Information sharing protocol" solution
