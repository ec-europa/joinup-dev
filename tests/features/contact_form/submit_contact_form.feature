  In order to gather feedback from the users
  As a moderator
  I want to collect wishes and grievances through a contact form

  @email
  Scenario: Submit a message as an anonymous user
    Given users:
      | Username                | Roles     |
      | Valentína Řezník        | moderator |
      | Oluwakanyinsola Opeyemi | moderator |

    # There should be a link to the contact form in the footer.
    Given I am not logged in
    When I am on the homepage
    And I click "Contact Joinup Support" in the "Footer" region
    Then I should see the heading "Contact"
    And the "Category" select should contain the following options:
      | - Select a value -             |
      | Technical problem / bug report |

      | Inappropriate content          |
      | EU Login question              |
      | Other                          |
    # The honeypot field that needs to be empty on submission.
    Then the following fields should be present "user_homepage"
    And I should see the text "Submissions of this form are processed by a contractor of the European Commission."

    When I fill in the following:
      | First name     | Oswine                      |

      | Subject        | Screen reader accessibility |
      | Message        | Dear sir, madam, ...        |
    And I attach the file "logo.png" to "Attachment"
    # We need to wait 5 seconds for the spam protection time limit to pass.
    And I wait for the spam protection time limit to pass
    And I press "Submit"

    # Both moderators should have received the notification e-mail.
    Then the following email should have been sent:
      | template           | Contact form submission                       |
      | from               | digit-joinup@ec.europa.eu                     |
      | recipient_mail     | DIGIT-JOINUP-SUPPORT-EXT-FORWARD@ec.europa.eu |
      | subject            | Joinup - Contact form submission              |
      | body               | Dear sir, madam, ...                          |
      | signature_required | no                                            |
    And I should see the following success messages:
      | success messages                                              |
      | Your message has been submitted. Thank you for your feedback. |
    When I click the link for the "logo.png" attachment in the contact form email sent to "DIGIT-JOINUP-SUPPORT-EXT-FORWARD@ec.europa.eu"
    # For anonymous users, the file should not be accessible.
    # The redirection to the EU login page returns a 200 code instead of a 403
    # so check for the page header instead.
    Then I should see the heading "Sign in to continue"
    When I am logged in as a moderator
    # Private files from contact forms are stored in
    # "<base url>/<private system path>/contact_form/<year>_<month>/<file>"
    And I click the link for the "logo.png" attachment in the contact form email sent to "DIGIT-JOINUP-SUPPORT-EXT-FORWARD@ec.europa.eu"
    # The server responds with an image.
    Then the content type of the response should be 'image/png'
