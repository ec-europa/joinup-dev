Feature: Add distribution through the UI
  In order to manage distributions
  As a moderator
  I need to be able to add "Distribution" RDF entities through the UI.

  Background:
    Given the following solution:
      | title       | Solution random x name           |
      | description | Some reusable random description |
      | state       | validated                        |
    And the following collection:
      | title      | Asset Distribution Test |
      | logo       | logo.png                |
      | affiliates | Solution random x name  |
      | state      | validated               |
    And the following release:
      | title         | 1.0.0 Authoritarian Alpaca |
      | description   | First public release.      |
      | is version of | Solution random x name     |
    And the following licence:
      | title       | WTFPL                                    |
      | description | The WTFPL is a rather permissive licence |

  Scenario: Add a distribution to a solution as a facilitator.
    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Solution random x name" solution
    And I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
    Then I should see the link "Add distribution"

    When I click "Add distribution"
    Then I should see the heading "Add Distribution"
    And the following fields should be present "Title, Description, Access URL, License, Format, Representation technique"
    And the following fields should not be present "Langcode, Translation"
    # @todo: The link has to be changed to the legal contact form.
    # @see: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-2789
    And I should see the link "contacting us"
    When I fill in "Title" with "Linux x86-64 SDK"
    And I enter "<p>The full software development kit for systems based on the x86-64 architecture.</p>" in the "Description" wysiwyg editor
    And I upload the file "test.zip" to "Access URL"
    And I select "GNU zip" from "Format"
    And I select "Web Ontology Language Full/DL/Lite" from "Representation technique"
    And I press "Save"
    # Regression test for required field.
    # @see: https://webgate.ec.europa/eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-3064
    Then I should see the error message "License field is required."
    When I select "WTFPL" from "License"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should have 1 distribution
    And the "Linux x86-64 SDK" distribution should have the link of the "test.zip" in the access URL field

    # Check if the asset distribution is accessible.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
    Then I should see the text "Distribution"
    And I should see the link "Linux x86-64 SDK"
    When I click "Linux x86-64 SDK"
    Then I should see the heading "Linux x86-64 SDK"
    And I should see the link "WTFPL"
    And I should see the text "The full software development kit for systems based on the x86-64 architecture."

    # The licence label should be shown also in the solution UI.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
    Then I should see the text "WTFPL"
    # Clean up the asset distribution that was created through the UI.
    Then I delete the "Linux x86-64 SDK" asset distribution

  # Test that unauthorized users cannot add a distribution, both for a release
  # and directly from the solution page.
  Scenario: "Add distribution" button should not be shown to unprivileged users.

    # Debug step since the default view of the distribution, does not have the access URL shown.
    And the "Source tarball" distribution should have the link of the "test.zip" in the access URL field

    # Check if the asset distribution is accessible as an anonymous user

    And I should see the link "Source tarball"
    When I click "Source tarball"

    And I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
    # Clean up the asset distribution that was created through the UI.
    Then I delete the "Source tarball" asset distribution

  Scenario: The distribution access URL field should accept multiple file extensions.
    Given I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Solution random x name" solution

  Scenario: Adding a distribution with a duplicate title
    Given the following solution:
      | title       | Solubility of gases     |
      | description | Affected by temperature |
      | state       | validated               |
    And the following release:
      | title         | 1.0.0 Adolf Sieverts |
      | description   | First public release |
      | is version of | Solubility of gases  |

    # Distributions should have a unique title within a single release.
    And I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Solution random x name" solution
    When I go to the homepage of the "1.0.0 Authoritarian Alpaca" release
    And I click "Add distribution" in the plus button menu
    When I fill in "Title" with "MacOSX binary"
    And I select "WTFPL" from "License"

    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the error message "A distribution with title MacOSX binary already exists in this release. Please choose a different title."
    And I should have 1 distribution

    Given I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Solubility of gases" solution
    When I go to the homepage of the "1.0.0 Adolf Sieverts" release
    And I click "Add distribution" in the plus button menu
    When I fill in "Title" with "MacOSX binary"
    And I select "WTFPL" from "License"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should have 2 distributions

    # Clean up the entities created through the user interface.
    Then I delete the "MacOSX binary" asset distribution
    And I delete the "MacOSX binary" asset distribution

  Scenario: Distributions with the same name should not be allowed within the same solution.
    Given the following distribution:
      | title       | Windows - source       |
      | description | Sample description     |
      | access url  | test.zip               |
      | parent      | Solution random x name |
    And I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Solution random x name" solution
    When I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
    And I click "Add distribution" in the plus button menu
    When I fill in "Title" with "Windows - source"
    And I select "WTFPL" from "License"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the error message "A distribution with title Windows - source already exists in this solution. Please choose a different title."

  Scenario: Licences are not shown in the solution header.
    Given the following licence:
      | title       | Boost Software License                                                         |
      | description | It is a permissive license in the style of the BSD license and the MIT license |
    And distributions:
      | title        | licence                | parent                 |
      | Hot Snake    | WTFPL                  | Solution random x name |
      | Quality Yard | Boost Software License | Solution random x name |

    When I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
    # Distributions are still shown in the solution page and so the License text will be visible in the page.
    Then I should not see the text "WTFPL" in the "Header" region
    And I should not see the text "Boost Software License" in the "Header" region
