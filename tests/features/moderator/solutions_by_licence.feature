Feature: Solutions by licence report
  As a moderator of the site
  In order to be able to manage licences of the website
  I need to be able to list the licences and their related solutions.

  Scenario: Only privileged users can access the report.
    When I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated" role
    And I go to "/admin/reporting/solutions-by-licences"
    Then the response status code should be 403

    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I am on the homepage
    And I click "Reporting" in the "Administration toolbar" region
    And I click "Solutions by licence"
    Then the response status code should be 200

  Scenario: List licences and their solutions.
    Given the following licences:
      | title          |
      | Open source    |
      | Free for all   |
      | Commercial     |
