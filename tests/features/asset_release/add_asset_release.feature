Feature: "Add release" visibility options.
  In order to manage releases
  As a solution facilitator
  I need to be able to add "Release" rdf entities through UI.

  Scenario: "Add release" button should only be shown to solution facilitators.
    Given the following solution:
      | title         | Release solution test |
      | description   | My awesome solution   |
      | documentation | text.pdf              |
      | state         | validated             |

    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Release solution test" solution
    And I go to the homepage of the "Release solution test" solution
    # The user has to press the '+' button for the option "Add release" to be
    # visible.
    Then I should see the link "Add release"

    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the homepage of the "Release solution test" solution
    Then I should not see the link "Add release"

    When I am an anonymous user
    And I go to the homepage of the "Release solution test" solution
    Then I should not see the link "Add release"

  Scenario: Add release as a solution facilitator.
    Given the following owner:
      | name                 | type    |
      | Organisation example | Company |
    And the following solutions:
      | title          | description        | documentation | owner                | state     |
      | Release Test 1 | test description 1 | text.pdf      | Organisation example | validated |
      | Release Test 2 | test description 2 | text.pdf      | Organisation example | validated |
    # Check that the release cannot take the title of another solution.
    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Release Test 1" solution
    When I go to the homepage of the "Release Test 1" solution
    And I click "Add release"
    Then I should see the heading "Add Release"
    And the following fields should be present "Name, Release number, Release notes, Documentation, Spatial coverage, Keyword, Status, Language"
    # The entity is new, so the current workflow state should not be shown.
    And the following fields should not be present "Description, Logo, Banner, Solution type, Contact information, Included asset, Translation, Distribution, Current workflow state"
    When I fill in "Name" with "Release Test 2"
    And I fill in "Release number" with "1.1"
    And I fill in "Release notes" with "Changed release."
    # Ensure that the Status field is a dropdown.
    # @see: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-3342
    And I select "Completed" from "Status"
    And I press "Publish"
    Then I should see the error message "Content with name Release Test 2 already exists."

    # Check that the same title as the parent is valid.
    When I fill in "Name" with "Release Test 1 v2"
    And I press "Publish"
    Then I should have 1 release

    # Verify that the "Release Test 1 v2" is registered as a release to "Release Test 1" solution.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Release Test 1" solution
    Then I should see the text "Download releases"
    When I click "Download releases"
    Then I should see the text "Release Test 1 v2"

    # Check that the release cannot take the title of another release in another solution.
    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Release Test 2" solution
    When I go to the homepage of the "Release Test 2" solution
    And I click "Add release"
    Then I should see the heading "Add Release"
    And the following fields should be present "Name, Release number, Release notes"
    When I fill in "Name" with "Release Test 1 v2"
    And I fill in "Release number" with "1.1"
    And I fill in "Release notes" with "Changed release."
    And I press "Publish"
    Then I should see the error message "Content with name Release Test 1 v2 already exists."

    # Cleanup created release.
    Then I delete the "Release Test 1 v2" release

  Scenario: Do not allow access to the page if the parent is not a solution.
    Given the following collection:
      | uri   | http://example1regression |
      | title | The Stripped Stream       |
      | state | validated                 |

    When I am not logged in
    And I go to "/rdf_entity/http_e_f_fexample1regression/asset_release/add"
    Then I should see the heading "Page not found"

    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I go to "/rdf_entity/http_e_f_fexample1regression/asset_release/add"
    Then I should see the heading "Page not found"
