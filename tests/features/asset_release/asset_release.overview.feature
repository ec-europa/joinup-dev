Feature: Asset distribution overview on solution.
  In order to view an overview of a solution's releases and download them
  As a user of the website
  I need to be able to view the releases of a solution.

  Scenario: Releases should be available in the overview page.
    Given the following collection:
      | title      | End of Past      |
      | state      | validated        |
    And the following solutions:
      | title            | collection  | description        | state     |
      | Lovely Butterfly | End of Past | Sample description | validated |
    # The release numbers do not follow the creation date to ensure proper
    # ordering. "The Child of the Past" should be shown first as it is the
    # latest release created, even though it is not the latest in the version
    # number.
    And the following releases:
      | title                 | documentation | release number | release notes | creation date    | is version of    | state     |
      | Hidden spies          | text.pdf      | 3              | Notes 3       | 28-01-1995 12:05 | Lovely Butterfly | draft     |
      | Thief in the Angels   | text.pdf      | 2              | Notes 2       | 28-01-1995 12:06 | Lovely Butterfly | validated |
      | The Child of the Past | text.pdf      | 1              | Notes 1       | 28-01-1996 12:05 | Lovely Butterfly | validated |
    And the following asset distributions:
      | title       | access url                          | creation date    | parent                |
      | Linux       | test.zip                            | 28-01-1995 12:05 | Thief in the Angels   |
      | Windows     | http://www.example.org/download.php | 28-01-1995 12:06 | The Child of the Past |
