Feature: Creation of news through the UI.
  In order to manage news
  As a user
  I need to be able to create news through the UI.

  Scenario: Share the news in other collections/solutions.
    Given the following collections:
      | title            | description                                 | logo     | banner     | state     |
      | Metal fans       | Share the love for nickel, tungsten & co.   | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
      | Hardcore diggers | We dig up stuff hidden beneath the earth.   | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
      | Cool blacksmiths | Keeping it cool while working on hot stuff. | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
    And solutions:
      | title                     | description                               | logo     | banner     | state     |
      | Density catalogue project | Catalog density on metals with ease.      | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
      | Dig do's and don'ts       | How to dig up stuff with style.           | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
      | Anvil test routines       | How to determine reliability of the tool. | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |

    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Metal fans" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "Metal fans" collection
    Then the following fields should not be present "Shared in"

    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Density catalogue project" solution
    And I go to the homepage of the "Density catalogue project" solution
    And I click "Add news"
    And I fill in the following:
      | Kicker         | Ytterbium metal of the year                                                                   |
      | Headline       | Strong request for this rare metal that is on the mouth of everybody                          |
      | Content        | Thanks to its lower density compared to thulium and lutetium its applications have increased. |
      | Add a new file | test.zip                                                                                      |
      | Add a new file | text.pdf                                                                                      |

    # Share the content in another solution.
    When I fill in "Referenced solution" with "Dig do's and don'ts"
    And I press "Publish"
    Then I should see the success message "News Ytterbium metal of the year has been created."
    # Verify that the referenced collection is rendered as tile.
    And I should see the "Dig do's and don'ts" tile

    # Edit again and try to share into the same solution.
    When I click "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region
    And I fill in "Referenced solution" with values "Dig do's and don'ts, Dig do's and don'ts"
    And I press "Update"
    Then I should see the error message "The value Dig do's and don'ts is already selected for field Referenced solution."

    # Add another collection in the field.
    When I fill in "Referenced solution" with values "Dig do's and don'ts, Anvil test routines"
    And I press "Update"
    Then I should see the success message "News Ytterbium metal of the year has been updated."
    # Verify that the tiles are shown.
    Then I should see the "Dig do's and don'ts" tile
    And I should see the "Anvil test routines" tile
