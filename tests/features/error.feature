@api @errorPage @group-a
Feature: On errors I want to see a friendly page and be able to report an
  incident number/code.

  Scenario: Test exception, fatal error, user error.

    # We're not using a scenario outline as that would be too expensive because
    # it would run the before/after hooks on each example.

    # Error level: hide.
    Given the site error reporting verbosity is "hide"
