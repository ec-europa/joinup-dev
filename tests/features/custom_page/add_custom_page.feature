Feature: "Add custom page" visibility options.
  In order to manage custom pages
  As a collection member
  I need to be able to add "Custom page" content through UI.

  Scenario: Links and help text for adding custom pages should should only be shown to privileged users
    Given the following collection:
      | title | Code Camp |
      | logo  | logo.png  |
      | state | validated |

    # Custom pages cannot be added by normal members. Custom pages are
    # considered to be important, and are not considered 'community content'.
    When I am logged in as a member of the "Code Camp" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "Code Camp" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add custom page" in the "Plus button menu"
    And I should not see the link "Add a new page" in the "Left sidebar"
    And I should not see the text "There are no pages yet. Why don't you start by creating an About page?"
    # If the normal member is promoted to facilitator, the links and help text
    # should become visible.
    Given my role in the "Code Camp" collection changes to facilitator
    And I reload the page
    Then I should see the link "Add custom page" in the "Plus button menu"
    And I should see the contextual link "Add new page" in the "Left sidebar" region

    # An authenticated user which is not a member should also not see the links
    # and help text.
    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the homepage of the "Code Camp" collection
    Then I should not see the plus button menu
    And I should not see the link "Add a new page" in the "Left sidebar"
    And I should not see the text "There are no pages yet. Why don't you start by creating an About page?"

    # An anonymous user should also not see the links and help text.
    When I am an anonymous user
    And I go to the homepage of the "Code Camp" collection
    Then I should not see the plus button menu
    And I should not see the link "Add a new page" in the "Left sidebar"
    And I should not see the text "There are no pages yet. Why don't you start by creating an About page?"

    # A facilitator should see it.
    When I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Code Camp" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "Code Camp" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add custom page" in the "Plus button menu"
    And I should see the contextual link "Add new page" in the "Left sidebar" region

  Scenario: Add custom page as a facilitator.
    Given collections:
      | title           | logo      | state     |
      | Open Collective | logo.png  | validated |
      | Code Camp       | logo.png  | validated |
    And I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Open Collective" collection

    # Initially there are no custom pages. A help text should inform the user
    # that it is possible to add custom pages.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Open Collective" collection
    Then the "Open Collective" collection should have 0 custom pages
    And I should see the contextual link "Add new page" in the "Left sidebar" region
    When I click the contextual link "Add new page" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then I should see the heading "Add custom page"
    And the following fields should be present "Title, Body"

    # The sections about managing revisions and groups should not be visible.
    And I should not see the text "Revision information"
    And the following fields should not be present "Groups audience, Other groups, Create new revision, Revision log message"

    When I fill in the following:
      | Title | About us                      |
    And I enter "We are open about everything!" in the "Body" wysiwyg editor
    And I attach the file "test.zip" to "Add a new file"
    And I press "Upload"
    # The "Description" field is the description of the file.
    And I fill in "Description" with "Test file"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the heading "About us"
    And I should see the success message "Custom page About us has been created."
    And I should see the text "Attachments"
    # The description of the file is set as the text to display.
    And I should see the link "Test file"
    And the "Open Collective" collection should have a custom page titled "About us"
    # Check that the link to the custom page is visible on the collection page.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Open Collective" collection
    And I click "About us"
    # Check that the collection content such as the 'Join collection block' is
    # available in context of the custom page.
    Then I should see the link "Leave this collection"

    # I should not be able to add a custom page to a different collection
    When I go to the homepage of the "Code Camp" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add custom page"

  Scenario: Add custom page as a moderator.
    Given users:
      | Username | Roles     |
      | Falstad  | moderator |
    And collections:
      | title           | logo      | state     |
      | Open Collective | logo.png  | validated |
      | Code Camp       | logo.png  | validated |
    And collection user memberships:
      | collection      | user    | roles  |
      | Open Collective | Falstad | member |

    # Moderators can add custom pages in any collection, whether they are a member or not.
    Given I am logged in as "Falstad"
    When I go to the homepage of the "Open Collective" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add custom page" in the "Plus button menu"

    When I go to the homepage of the "Code Camp" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add custom page" in the "Plus button menu"
