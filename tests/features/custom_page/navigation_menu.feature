Feature: Navigation menu for custom pages
  In order to determine the order and visibility of custom pages in the navigation menu
  As a facilitator
  I need to be able to manage the navigation menu

  Scenario Outline: Access the navigation menu through the contextual link
    Given the following <group>s:
      | title            | logo     | state     |
      | Rainbow tables   | logo.png | validated |
      | Cripple Mr Onion | logo.png | validated |

    # By default, a link to the collection canonical page and a link to the
    # about page are added to the menu.
    When I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    And I go to the homepage of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    Then the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group> should have <visible items 1> visible items
    And I should see the following group menu items in the specified order:
      | text     |
      | Overview |
      | Members  |
      | About    |
    # Check that the 'Edit menu' local action is present.
    And I should see the contextual link "Edit menu" in the "Left sidebar" region
    # The 'Add link' local action that is present in the default implementation
    # of OG Menu should not be visible. We are managing the menu links behind
    # the scenes. The end user should not be able to interact with these.
    But I should not see the contextual link "Add link" in the "Left sidebar" region

    # When we create a custom page it should automatically show up in the menu.
    When I click the contextual link "Add new page" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then I should see the heading "Add custom page"
    When I fill in the following:
      | Title | About us |
    And I enter "A short introduction." in the "Body" wysiwyg editor
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the success message "Custom page About us has been created."
    And the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group> should have <visible items 2> visible items

    When I click the contextual link "Edit menu" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group> should have 5 items

    # It should be possible to hide an item from the menu by disabling it.
    When I disable "About us" in the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    Then the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group> should have <visible items 3> visible items

    # When all the pages are disabled in the navigation menu, a message should
    # be shown to the user.
    When I disable "Overview" in the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    And I disable "Members" in the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    And I disable "About" in the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    And I go to the homepage of the "Rainbow tables" <group>
    Then I should see the text "All the pages have been disabled for this <group>. You can edit the menu configuration or add a new page."
    And I should see the contextual link "Edit menu" in the "Left sidebar" region

    # The contextual menu can be used to navigate to the menu edit page.
    When I click the contextual link "Edit menu" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then I should see the heading "Edit navigation menu of the Rainbow tables <group>"

    # The form to add a new menu link should not be accessible by anyone. This
    # is functionality provided by Drupal which is intended for webmasters. We
    # are showing the menu overview to collection facilitators so they can
    # reorder the navigation menu, but they should not be able to access the
    # related menu administration screens.
    And I should not have access to the menu link administration pages for the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group>

    # Enable the menu entry for the 'About us' page again so we can check if it
    # is visible for all users.
    When I enable "About us" in the navigation menu of the "Rainbow tables" <group>

    # Create a few custom pages in the second collection so we can check if the
    # right menu shows up in each collection.
    Given custom_page content:
      | title           | body                                                                                                                                  | <group>          |
