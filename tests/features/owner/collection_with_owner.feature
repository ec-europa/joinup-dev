Feature: Creation of owners through UI
  In order to manage owners
  As a user
  I need to be able to create owners, or add existing, through the UI when proposing a collection.

  @terms
  Scenario: Propose a collection
    Given the following owner:
      | name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | type    |
      | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris fermentum ante arcu. Vivamus nisl turpis, fringilla ut ante sit amet, bibendum iaculis ante. Nullam vel nisl vehicula, rutrum ante nec, placerat dolor. Sed id odio imperdiet, efficitur lacus | Company |
    And I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated" role
    When I go to the propose collection form
    Then the following field widgets should be present "Contact information, Owner"
    When I fill in the following:
      | Title       | Classical and Ancient Mythology                                                                      |
      | Description | The seminal work on the ancient mythologies of the primitive and classical peoples of the Discworld. |
      # Contact information data.
      | Name        | Larry Joe                                                                                            |
      | E-mail      | larry.joe@example.com                                                                                |
    When I select "EU and European Policies" from "Policy domain"
    And I attach the file "logo.png" to "Logo"
    And I attach the file "banner.jpg" to "Banner"

    # Click the button to create an organisation owner.
    And I press "Add new" at the "Owner" field
    # Since it is a 'propose' form, the field is not shown for the parent either.
    # It is safe to check that the field is not found in the entire form.
    Then the following fields should not be present "Current workflow state, Langcode, Translation"

    # Click the button to select an existing owner.

    And I pick "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris fermentum ante arcu. Vivamus nisl turpis, fringilla ut ante sit amet, bibendum iaculis ante. Nullam vel nisl vehicula, rutrum ante nec, placerat dolor. Sed id odio imperdiet, efficitur lacus" from the "Owner" autocomplete suggestions

    # Clean up the collection that was created.
    Then I delete the "Classical and Ancient Mythology" collection
    And I delete the "Larry Joe" contact information
