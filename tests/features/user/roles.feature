Feature: User role management
  As a moderator I must be able to assign roles to users.

  Background:
    Given users:
      | Username   | Roles     | E-mail                 |
      | Rick Rolls | Moderator | rick.roles@example.com |
      | Nibby Noob |           | nicky.noob@example.com |
      | Ursus      |           |                        |
    And all e-mails have been sent

  Scenario: Verify options available to the moderator.
    Given I am logged in as "Rick Rolls"
    And I am on the homepage
    And I click "People"

    Then the "Action" field should contain the "Add the Moderator role to the selected user(s), Remove the Moderator role from the selected user(s), Add the Licence manager role to the selected user(s), Remove the Licence manager role from the selected user(s)" options
    And the available options in the "Action" select should not include the "Add the Administrator role to the selected user(s), Remove the Administrator role from the selected user(s)" options

  Scenario: A moderator can assign the moderator role.
