Feature: Password management
  As a registered user of the website
  I want to be able to manage and restore my password
  So that I can access my account

  Background:
    Given users:
      | Username       | E-mail                     | Password | First name | Family name |
      | Charlie Change | charlie.change@example.com | changeme | Charlie    | Change      |

  Scenario Outline: A registered user cannot set passwords that do not comply with the policy.
    When I am logged in as "Charlie Change"
    And I am on the homepage
    And I click "My account"
    And I click "Edit"
    And I fill in "Current password" with "changeme"
    And I fill in "Password" with "<password>"
    And I fill in "Confirm password" with "<password>"
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should see the error message "The password does not satisfy the password policies"
    Examples:
      | password   |
      # Less than 8 characters.
      | tEst1      |
      # Contains only lowercase and uppercase.
      | tEsttest   |
      # Contains only lowercase and uppercase.
      | t3sttest   |
      # Contains only lowercase and special characters.

      # Contains only numeric and special characters.
