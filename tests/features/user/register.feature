Feature: User registration
  As a user I must be able to register to the site and complete my user profile
  and receive appropriate notifications.

  Scenario: User can find the register page
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I am on the homepage
    And I click "Sign in"
    Then I am at "/user/login"
    When I click "Create new account"
    Then I am at "/user/register"

  Scenario: User can register with minimal required fields
    Given all e-mails have been sent
    And the following user registration at "/user/register":
      | E-mail      | Test-User@Example.com |
      | Username    | TeStUSer              |
      | First name  | Test                  |
      | Family name | User                  |
    Then I should see the success message "A welcome message with further instructions has been sent to your email address."
    And the following system email should have been sent:
      | recipient | TeStUSer                                                                                                                                                                                       |
