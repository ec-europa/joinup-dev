  Scenario Outline: Administrators, moderators and owners can transfer the group ownership.
    Given I am logged in as "<user>"
    And I go to the homepage of the "<title>" <type>
    And I click "Members"

    # Try to transfer the ownership to the current owner.
    Given I select the "cruel" row
    And I select "Transfer the ownership of the <type> to the selected member" from "Action"
    When I press "Apply to selected items"
    Then I should see "Member Finnur Robertsson is already the owner of <title> <type>. Please select other user."

    # Try to transfer the ownership to multiple users.
    Given I select the "loner" row
    And I select the "shy" row
    And I select "Transfer the ownership of the <type> to the selected member" from "Action"
    When I press "Apply to selected items"
    Then I should see "You cannot transfer the <type> ownership to more than one user. Please select a single user."

    Given I select the "shy" row
    And I select "Transfer the ownership of the <type> to the selected member" from "Action"
    When I press "Apply to selected items"
    Then I should see "Are you sure you want to transfer the ownership of <title> <type> to Ásdís Sigurðsdóttir?"

    When I press "Confirm"
    Then I should see "Ownership of <title> <type> transferred from users Finnur Robertsson, Edda Agnarsdóttir to Ásdís Sigurðsdóttir."
    And I should see the text "<type capitalized> owner" in the "shy" row
    # Because the 'happy' user is granted with the site-wide permission
    # ('administer {group} ownership'), he is not dependent on the ownership
    # changes within the group, thus he's able to manage the group ownership
    # again. But the user 'cruel' cannot access anymore the option to manage the
    # ownership because, by transferring its ownership, he has locked out
    # himself from administering the group ownership.
    And the "Action" field should <option exists> the "Transfer the ownership of the <type> to the selected member" option
    And I should not see the text "<type capitalized> owner" in the "cruel" row
    # The former owners are receiving, in compensation, the facilitator role.
    But I should see the text "<type capitalized> facilitator" in the "cruel" row
    And I should not see the text "<type capitalized> owner" in the "frozen" row
    # The former owners are receiving, in compensation, the facilitator role.
    But I should see the text "<type capitalized> facilitator" in the "frozen" row
    # The new owner should be notified.
    And the following email should have been sent:
      | recipient | shy                                                             |
      | subject   | Your role has been changed to owner                             |
      | body      | <full name> has changed your role in <type> "<title>" to owner. |
    # The old owners that were demoted to facilitator should be notified.
    And the following email should have been sent:
      | recipient | cruel                                                                 |
      | subject   | Your role has been changed to facilitator                             |
      | body      | <full name> has changed your role in <type> "<title>" to facilitator. |
    And the following email should have been sent:
      | recipient | frozen                                                                |
      | subject   | Your role has been changed to facilitator                             |
      | body      | <full name> has changed your role in <type> "<title>" to facilitator. |

    Examples:
      | user  | option exists | type       | type capitalized | title                       | full name               |
      | happy | contain       | collection | Collection       | Intensive Language Learning | The Joinup Support Team |
      | light | contain       | collection | Collection       | Intensive Language Learning | The Joinup Support Team |
      | cruel | not contain   | collection | Collection       | Intensive Language Learning | Finnur Robertsson       |

  Scenario Outline: Group facilitators do not have access to transfer ownership.
    Given I am logged in as "shy"
    And I go to the homepage of the "<title>" <type>
    Given I click "Members"
    Then the available options in the "Action" select should not include the "Transfer the ownership of the <type> to the selected member" options

    Examples:
      | type       | title                       |
      | collection | Intensive Language Learning |
      | solution   | Learn German in 1 Month     |

  Scenario: Collection owner cannot transfer ownership of a child solution, neither viceversa.
    Given the following collection:
      | title | Babylon   |
      | state | validated |
    And the following solution:
      | title      | Rivers Of Babylon |
      | collection | Babylon           |
      | state      | validated         |
    And collection user membership:
      | collection | user  | roles       |
      | Babylon    | shy   | owner       |
      | Babylon    | loner | facilitator |
    And solution user membership:
      | solution          | user  | roles       |
      | Rivers Of Babylon | loner | owner       |
      | Rivers Of Babylon | shy   | facilitator |

    Given I am logged in as "shy"
    And I go to the homepage of the "Rivers Of Babylon" solution
    Given I click "Members"
    Then the available options in the "Action" select should not include the "Transfer the ownership of the solution to the selected member" options

    Given I am logged in as "loner"
    And I go to the homepage of the "Babylon" collection
    Given I click "Members"
    Then the available options in the "Action" select should not include the "Transfer the ownership of the solution to the selected member" options

  # In Joinup every owner is also a facilitator, so if a normal member is
  # promoted to owner, they should also become a facilitator.
  Scenario Outline: If ownership is transferred to a normal member, it should also include the facilitator role
    Given I am logged in as "light"
    And I go to the homepage of the "<title>" <group type>
    And I click "Members"
    And I select the "loner" row
    And I select "Transfer the ownership of the <group type> to the selected member" from "Action"
    When I press "Apply to selected items"
    Then I should see "Are you sure you want to transfer the ownership of <title> <group type> to Freyja Stefánsdóttir?"
    When I press "Confirm"
    Then I should see "Ownership of <title> <group type> transferred from users Finnur Robertsson, Edda Agnarsdóttir to Freyja Stefánsdóttir."
    And I should see the text "<type capitalized> owner, <type capitalized> facilitator" in the "loner" row

    Examples:
      | group type | type capitalized | title                       |
      | collection | Collection       | Intensive Language Learning |
      | solution   | Solution         | Learn German in 1 Month     |
