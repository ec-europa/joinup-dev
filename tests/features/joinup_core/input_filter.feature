  Scenario: Videos
    When I go to the "Jessica Jones returns" news
    Then I should see the "iframe" element in the Content region
    Then I see the "iframe" element with the "src" attribute set to "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nWHUjuJ8zxE" in the "Content" region
    When I go to the "Luke cage" news
    Then I should not see the "iframe" element with the "src" attribute set to "https://www.example.com" in the "Content" region

  @javascript
  Scenario: Tags h1, h5, h6 can exist in a formatted text but the user does not have these options on the editor.
    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I go to the "Ragged Crying" news
    Then I should see "test h1" in the "h1" element in the "Content" region
    And I should see "test h2" in the "h2" element in the "Content" region
    And I should see "test h3" in the "h3" element in the "Content" region
    And I should see "test h4" in the "h4" element in the "Content" region
    And I should see "test h5" in the "h5" element in the "Content" region
    And I should see "test h6" in the "h6" element in the "Content" region

    # Ensure that the user does not have access to disallowed paragraph formats.
    And I open the header local tasks menu
    And I click "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region
    Then the paragraph formats in the "Content" field should not contain the "h1, h5, h6" format
