Feature: Pinning content entities inside solutions
  As a facilitator of a solution
  I want to pin content at the top of the solution homepage
  So that important content has more visibility

  Background:
    Given the following solutions:
      | title       | state     |
      | Blue Wrench | validated |
      | Sunny Beam  | validated |
    And users:
      | Username          | E-mail                        |
      | Sara Jessica      | sara.jessica@example.com      |
      | Tyron Lannister   | tyron.lannister@example.com   |
      | Andy Garcia       | andy.garcia@example.com       |
      | Melahrini Gilbert | melahrini.gilbert@example.com |
    And the following solution user memberships:
      | solution    | user              | roles       |
      | Blue Wrench | Sara Jessica      | facilitator |
      | Sunny Beam  | Sara Jessica      | facilitator |
      | Blue Wrench | Tyron Lannister   |             |
      | Sunny Beam  | Andy Garcia       | facilitator |
      | Sunny Beam  | Melahrini Gilbert |             |

  Scenario Outline: Facilitators can pin and unpin community content inside their solutions.
    Given discussion content:
      | title                      | solution    | state     | created    |
      | What is the HEX for lemon? | Blue Wrench | validated | 2018-10-03 |
    And <content type> content:
      | title              | solution    | state     | pinned | created    |
      | Very important     | Blue Wrench | validated | yes    | 2018-11-03 |
      | Useful information | Blue Wrench | validated | no     | 2018-12-03 |

    When I am an anonymous user
    And I go to the homepage of the "Blue Wrench" solution
    Then I should see the following tiles in the correct order:
      | Very important             |
      | Useful information         |
      | What is the HEX for lemon? |
    Then I should not see the contextual links "Pin, Unpin" in the "Useful information" tile
    And I should not see the contextual links "Pin, Unpin" in the "Very important" tile

    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
