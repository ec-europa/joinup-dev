    # Wait for contextual links to be generated. There is a session race condition that happens when a contextual link
    # has a CSRF token. The session will store the seed if not yet present, but if a new request is made before the
    # session is persisted, the seed won't be found and regenerated. For this reason, the already generated contextual
    # links with CSRF tokens won't be valid anymore.
