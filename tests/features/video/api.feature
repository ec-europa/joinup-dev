@api
Feature: Video API
  In order to manage videos programmatically
  As a backend developer
  I need to be able to use the Node API to handle the "Video" bundle

  # This is a temporary test until we have proper support for videos.
  # The machine names are used but should be replaced with proper names once the video functionality is implemented.
  Scenario: Programmatically create a Video entity in collection
    Given the following owner:
      | name         |
      | Video editor |
    And the following collection:
      | title             | Video library |
      | owner             | Video editor  |
      | logo              | logo.png      |
      | moderation        | yes           |
      | elibrary creation | facilitators  |
      | state             | validated     |
    And video content:
      | title       | body        | field_video                                 | og_audience   |
      | Dummy Video | Dummy text. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLcS7uIlqPo | Video library |
    Then I should have a "Video" page titled "Dummy Video"

    # Regression test for asserting that the video should appear as a tile.
    # @todo: This should move to the appropriate test once the video functionality is implemented.
    When I go to the homepage of the "Video library" collection
    Then I should see the "Dummy Video" tile
