Feature: User authentication
  In order to protect the integrity of the website
  As a product owner
  I want to make sure users with various roles can only access pages they are authorized to

  Scenario Outline: Anonymous user can access public pages
    Given I am not logged in
    Then I visit "<path>"

    Examples:
      | path          |
      | collections   |
      | user/login    |
      | user/password |
      | user/register |

  Scenario Outline: Anonymous user cannot access restricted pages
    Given I am not logged in
    When I go to "<path>"
    Then I should see the heading "Sign in to continue"

    Examples:
      | path                                        |
      | admin                                       |
