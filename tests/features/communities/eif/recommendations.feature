Feature:
  As the owner of the EIF Toolbox
  in order to promote solutions we want to recommend
  I need to be able to present the solutions and the recommendations in the EIF Toolbox.

  Scenario: Recommendations page is only accessible through the EIF Toolbox solution.
    Given the following collection:
      | title | Test collection |
      | state | validated       |
    Given the following solution:
      | title           | Test solution                        |
      | collection      | Test collection                      |
      | landing page    | http://foo-example.com/landing       |
      | webdav creation | no                                   |
      | webdav url      | http://joinup.eu/solution/foo/webdav |
      | wiki            | http://example.wiki/foobar/wiki      |
      | state           | validated                            |
    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I go to "/collection/test-collection/solution/test-solution"
    Then I should see the heading "Test solution"

    When I go to "/collection/test-collection/solution/test-solution/recommendations"
    Then the response status code should be 404

    # Visibility of recommendations page depends on the view access of the
    # parent solution. In order to avoid having two distinct scenario tags for
    # published and unpublished EIF Toolbox, transit the entity to the state
    # that deletes the validated version of the entity.
    Given the workflow state of the "EIF Toolbox" solution is changed to "blacklisted"
    And I am not logged in
    When I go to "/collection/nifo-collection/solution/eif-toolbox"
    Then I should see the heading "Sign in to continue"
    When I go to "/collection/nifo-collection/solution/eif-toolbox/recommendations"
    Then the response status code should be 404

  Scenario: The recommendations categories are properly sorted.
    Given I am not logged in
    And I go to the "EIF Toolbox" solution
    When I click "Recommendations" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then the "EIF recommendations" inline facet should allow selecting the following values:
      # (-) means it is selected.
      | (-) All                |
      | Underlying principle   |
      | Interoperability layer |
      | Conceptual model       |

  Scenario: The recommendations page lists the recommendations links.
    Given I am not logged in
    And I go to the "EIF Toolbox" solution
    When I click "Recommendations" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then I should see the heading "EIF recommendations"

    # Assert the full table.
    And the "eif recommendations" table should be:
      | Recommendation topics                         | EIF Pillars              | Recommendations                   |

    # Assert that recommendations are concatenated when grouped but only the first receive the keyword "Recommendation"
    # as part of the link.
    And I should see the link "Recommendation 20"
    And I should see the link "21"
    But I should not see the link "Recommendation 21"

    # Assert sub tables according to the facet.
    When I click "Conceptual model" in the "Content" region
    Then the "eif recommendations" table should be:

  Scenario: Recommendations overview and each recommendation should show the EIF Toolbox header
    Given I am not logged in
    And I go to the "EIF Toolbox" solution
    When I click "Recommendations" in the "Left sidebar" region
    Then I should see the heading "EIF Toolbox"

    When I click "Recommendation 1"
    Then I should see the heading "EIF Toolbox"
    # Ensure that the identifier field is hidden.
    And I should not see the text "Identifier"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Searching for anything, will not return eif recommendations as results.
    Given I am not logged in
    And I am on the homepage
    And I open the search bar by clicking on the search icon
    And I enter "Underlying Principle 4" in the search bar and press enter
    Then I should not see the text "Underlying Principle" in the "Content" region
