  As a privileged user
  In order to be able to see changes between revisions of my groups content
  I need to be able to access the revision-related pages inside my groups

  Scenario: Facilitators can access the revision-related pages.
    Given users:

      | state | validated     |
    And the following solution:
      | title | Carpenters DIY |
      | state | validated      |
    And collection user membership:
      | collection    | user         |

    And solution user membership:
      | solution       | user       |

    # Create a discussion in the collection.

    # Collection members cannot access the list of revisions, even if they are the authors.
    When I am logged in as "Ainslee Hext"
    And I go to the "Open-ended or open-ring spanners?" discussion
    Then I should not see the link "Revisions"
    # Same goes for solution members.
    When I am logged in as "Erik Quick"
    And I go to the "Orbital sander tearing off too fast?" discussion
    Then I should not see the link "Revisions"

    # Verify that collection facilitator has the permission to see revisions.
    When I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Mechanics 101" collection
    And I go to the "Mechanics FAQ" custom page
    # The custom page has only one revision, so the revisions link should not be visible yet.
    Then I should not see the link "Revisions"
    # Create a revision.
    When I click "Edit"
    And I enter "Common and not-so-common questions and answers." in the "Body" wysiwyg editor
    And I press "Save"
