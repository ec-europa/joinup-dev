Feature: Moderate community content
  In order to accept or reject content that is proposed for publication or deletion
  As a facilitator
  I need to be able to see a list of content that requires moderation

  Scenario: Content moderation overview
    Given the following collection:
      | title | Black hole research |
      | state | validated           |
    And the following solution:
      | title | Survey For Supernovae |
      | state | validated             |

    # Before adding content, check that the 'empty message' is displayed on the
    # content moderation overview.
    When I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Black hole research" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "Black hole research" collection
    # Contextual links should not be shown in the group header. All contextual
    # actions are instead handled through the "Entity actions". Since both are
    # themed similarly (as a "three dot menu") it is too confusing to have both
    # visible in the same area.
    Then I should not see any contextual links in the "Header" region
    And I click "Moderate content" in the "Entity actions" region
    Then I should see the heading "Content moderation"
    And I should see the text "Nothing to moderate. Enjoy your day!"

    # Add community content of all possible types in all possible states, to
    # both the collection and solution.
