Feature: Add community content
  In order to introduce my wisdom in my collections
  As a member of a collection 
  I need to be able to add community content

  Scenario Outline: Advanced content and group administration should not be accessible for group members
    Given the following collection:
      | title | The night shift |
      | state | validated       |

    When I am logged in as a "<member type>" of the "The night shift" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "The night shift" collection
    And I click "Add <content type>"
    Then I should see the heading "Add <content type>"
    But I should not see the following lines of text:
      | Authored by                  |
      | Authored on                  |
      | Create new revision          |
      | Generate automatic URL alias |
      | Groups audience              |
      | Other groups                 |
      | Promoted to front page       |
      | Revision information         |
      | Revision log message         |
      | Sticky at top of lists       |

    Examples:
      | member type | content type |
      | facilitator | discussion   |
      | facilitator | document     |
      | facilitator | event        |
      | facilitator | news         |
      | member      | discussion   |
      | member      | document     |
