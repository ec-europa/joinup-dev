Feature: Event API
  In order to manage custom pages programmatically
  As a backend developer
  I need to be able to use the Node API to handle the "Event" bundle

  Scenario: Programmatically create an Event entity
    Given the following owner:
      | name        | type    |
      | Event Owner | Company |
    And the following community:
      | title            | Le Event Heureux         |
      | owner            | Event Owner              |
      | logo             | logo.png                 |
      | moderation       | yes                      |
      | content creation | facilitators and authors |
      | state            | validated                |
    And event content:
      | title       | short title | body                                     | community       | start date          | end date            |
      | Dummy Event | Short       | This is some dummy content like foo:bar. | Le Event Heureux | 2016-03-15T11:12:12 | 2016-03-15T11:12:12 |
    Then I should have a "Event" page titled "Dummy Event"
