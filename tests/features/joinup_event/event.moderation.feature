  Scenario: Available transitions change per eLibrary and moderation settings.
    # For post-moderated collections with eLibrary set to allow all users to
    # create content, authenticated users that are not members can create
    # events.
    When I am logged in as "Salvador Thomas"
    And go to the homepage of the "Wet Lords" collection
    And I click "Add event" in the plus button menu
    # Post moderated collections allow publishing content directly.
    And I should see the button "Publish"

    # Edit the collection and set it as moderated.
