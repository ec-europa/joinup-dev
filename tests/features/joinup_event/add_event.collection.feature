Feature: "Add event" visibility options.
  In order to manage events
  As a collection member
  I need to be able to add "Event" content through UI.

  Scenario: "Add event" button should not be shown to normal members, authenticated users and anonymous users.
    Given the following collections:
      | title               | logo     | banner     | state     |
      | The Stripped Stream | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
      | Years in the Nobody | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |

    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the homepage of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add event"

    When I am an anonymous user
    And I go to the homepage of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add event"

    When I am logged in as a member of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add event"

    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add event"
    # I should not be able to add a event to a different collection
    When I go to the homepage of the "Years in the Nobody" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add event"

    When I am logged in as a "moderator"
    And I go to the homepage of the "The Stripped Stream" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add event"

  Scenario: Add event as a facilitator.
    Given collections:
