Feature: "Event page" editing.
  In order to manage events
  As an owner of the event
  I need to be able to edit it.

  Scenario: Add and remove map
    Given collections:
      | title  | logo     | banner     | state     |
      | Heroes | logo.png | banner.jpg | validated |
    And I am logged in as a facilitator of the "Heroes" collection
    When I go to the homepage of the "Heroes" collection
    And I click "Add event" in the plus button menu
    When I fill in the following:
      | Title             | Best event                                               |
      | Description       | It will be the best event this year.                     |
      | Physical location | Tower Bridge, Tower Bridge Road, London, United Kingdom. |
    And I press "Save as draft"
    Then I should see the heading "Best event"
    And I should see a map on the page
    When I click "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region
    Then I should see the heading "Edit Event Best event"
    When I clear the field "Physical location"
    And I enter the following for the "Virtual location" link field:
      | URL                              | Title           |
      | https://share-and-reuse.example/ | Share and reuse |
    And I press "Save as draft"
    Then I should see the heading "Best event"
    And I should not see a map on the page

  Scenario Outline: Owners and moderators should be able to view the Edit link.
    Given users:
      | Username |
      | <user>   |
    And the following collections:
      | title        | description        | state     | moderation |

    When I am logged in as "<user>"
    And I go to the "<event>" event
    Then I should see the link "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region
    # A moderator should always be able to edit the content.
    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I go to the "<event>" event
    Then I should see the link "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region

    And I go to the "Silver Snow" event
    Then I should see the link "Edit" in the "Entity actions" region
    # A moderator should always be able to edit the content.
    When I am logged in as a moderator
    And I go to the "Silver Snow" event
