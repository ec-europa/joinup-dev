Feature: Proposing a collection
  In order to create a new collection on Joinup
  As the product owner of a collection of software solutions
  I need to be able to propose a collection for inclusion on Joinup

  # the user will be aware that collections can be added by the public, even
  # though you need to sign in to do so.
