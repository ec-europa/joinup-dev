Feature: Proposing a collection
  In order to create a new collection on Joinup
  As the product owner of a collection of software solutions
  I need to be able to propose a collection for inclusion on Joinup

  # Todo: It still needs to be decided on which pages the "Propose collection"
  # button will be shown. It might be removed from the homepage in the future.
  # Ref. https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-2298

  # An anonymous user should be shown the option to add a collection, so that
  # the user will be aware that collections can be added by the public, even
  # though you need to log in to do so.
  Scenario: Anonymous user needs to log in before creating a collection
    Given users:
      | name          | pass  |
      | Cecil Clapman | claps |
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I am on the homepage
    And I click "Propose collection"
    Then I should see the error message "Access denied. You must log in to view this page."
    When I fill in the following:
      | Username | Cecil Clapman |
      | Password | claps         |
    And I press "Log in"
    Then I should see the heading "Propose collection"
  Scenario: Propose a collection
    Given the following organisation:
      | name | Organisation example |
    And I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated" role
    When I am on the homepage
    And I click "Propose collection"
    Then I should see the heading "Propose collection"
    And the following field widgets should be present "Contact information, Owner"
    When I fill in the following:

      | Spatial coverage | Belgium (http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/BEL)                               |
    And I attach the file "logo.png" to "Logo"
    And I attach the file "banner.jpg" to "Banner"
    And I check "Closed collection"
    And I select "Only members can create new content." from "eLibrary creation"

    # The user that proposed the collection should be auto-subscribed.
    And the "Ancient and Classical Mythology" collection should have 1 member
    # There should not be any custom pages in the menu yet, so I should see a
    # button to create a custom page, with accompanying help text.
    # And I should see the text "There are no pages yet. Why don't you start by creating an About page?"
    When I click "Add custom page"
    Then I should see the heading "Add custom page"
    When I fill in the following:
      | Title | About                                       |
      | Body  | Some more information about the collection. |
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the success message "Custom page About has been created."

    # Clean up the collection that was created.
    Then I delete the "Ancient and Classical Mythology" collection

      | Description | A guild of serious men with sacks in which things are struggling. |
    And I attach the file "logo.png" to "Logo"
    And I press "Save as draft"
    Then I should see the error message "Content with title The Ratcatcher's Guild already exists. Please choose a different title."

  # This is a regression test for a bug in which the label texts of the options
  # vanished after performing an AJAX request in a different element on the
  # page.
  # See https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-2589
  Scenario: E-library options should not vanish after AJAX request.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated" role
    When I go to the propose collection form
    And I attach the file "banner.jpg" to "Banner"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see the link "banner.jpg"

  Scenario: eLibrary creation options should adapt to the state of the 'closed collection' option
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated" role
    When I go to the propose collection form

    # Initially the collection is open, check if the eLibrary options are OK.
    Then the option "Only members can create new content." should be selected
    And the option "Any registered user can create new content." should not be selected
    And I should not see the text "Only collection facilitators can create new content."

    When I move the "eLibrary creation" slider to the right
    Then the option "Any registered user can create new content." should be selected
    And the option "Only members can create new content." should not be selected

    # When toggling to closed, the option 'any registered user' should disappear
    # and the option for facilitators should appear.
    # When I check "Closed collection"
    # Workaround, fixed in ISAICP-2703
    When I click on element ".js-form-item-field-ar-closed-value label"
    Then the option "Only members can create new content." should be selected
    And the option "Only collection facilitators can create new content." should not be selected
    And I should not see the text "Any registered user can create new content."

    # Check if moving the slider selects the correct option. Visually the handle
    # of the slider moves underneath the other option.
    When I move the "eLibrary creation" slider to the right
    Then the option "Only collection facilitators can create new content." should be selected
    And the option "Only members can create new content." should not be selected

    # This is a regression test for a bug in which the both the previous option
    # and the default option were selected after cycling the collection
    # checkbox status open-closed-open-closed.
    # See https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-2589
    # When I uncheck "Closed collection"
