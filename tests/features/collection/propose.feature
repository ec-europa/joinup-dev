Feature: Proposing a collection
  In order to create a new collection on Joinup
  As the product owner of a collection of software solutions
  I need to be able to propose a collection for inclusion on Joinup

  # An anonymous user should be shown the option to add a collection, so that
  # the user will be aware that collections can be added by the public, even
  # though you need to sign in to do so.
  Scenario: Anonymous user needs to sign in before creating a collection

  # This is a regression test for a bug where nothing was happening when
