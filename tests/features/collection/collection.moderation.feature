Feature: Collection moderation
  In order to manage collections programmatically
  As a user of the website
  I need to be able to transit the collections from one state to another.

  # Access checks are not being made here. They are run in the collection add feature.
  Scenario: 'Draft' and 'Propose' states are available but moderators should also see 'Validated' state.
    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the homepage
    And I click "Propose collection" in the plus button menu
    Then the following buttons should be present "Save as draft, Propose"
    And the following buttons should not be present "Publish, Request archival, Request deletion, Archive"

    When I am logged in as a user with the "moderator" role
    And I go to the homepage
    And I click "Propose collection" in the plus button menu
    Then the following buttons should be present "Save as draft, Propose, Publish"
    And the following buttons should not be present "Request archival, Request deletion, Archive"

    # The following table tests the allowed transitions in a collection.
    # For each entry, the following steps must be performed:
    # Login with the given user (or a user with the same permissions).
    # Go to the homepage of the given collection.
    # If the expected states (states column) are empty, I should not have access
    # to the edit screen.
    # If the expected states are not empty, then I see the "Edit" link.
    # When I click the "Edit" link
    # Then the state field should have only the given states available.
    Then for the following collection, the corresponding user should have the corresponding available state buttons:
      | collection              | user            | states                                                     |
