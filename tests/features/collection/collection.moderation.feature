Feature: Community moderation
  In order to manage communities programmatically
  As a user of the website
  I need to be able to transit the communities from one state to another.

  # Access checks are not being made here. They are run in the community add feature.
  Scenario: 'Draft' and 'Propose' states are available but moderators should also see 'Validated' state.
    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the propose community form
    Then the following buttons should be present "Save as draft, Propose"
    And the following buttons should not be present "Publish, Request archival, Archive"
    And I should not see the link "Delete"

    When I am logged in as a user with the "moderator" role
    And I go to the propose community form
    Then the following buttons should be present "Save as draft, Propose, Publish"
    And the following buttons should not be present "Request archival, Archive"
    And I should not see the link "Delete"

  Scenario: Test the available buttons in every stage of the editorial workflow
    Given the following owner:
      | name           |
      | Simon Sandoval |

    # The following table tests the allowed transitions in a community.
    # For each entry, the following steps must be performed:
    # Login with the given user (or a user with the same permissions).
    # Go to the homepage of the given community.
    # If the expected states (states column) are empty, I should not have access
    # to the edit screen.
    # If the expected states are not empty, then I see the "Edit" link.
    # When I click the "Edit" link
    # Then the state field should have only the given states available.
    Then for the following collection, the corresponding user should have the corresponding available state buttons:
      | collection          | user            | buttons                                           |
