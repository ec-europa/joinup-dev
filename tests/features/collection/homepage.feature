    And I go to the homepage of the "Middle earth daily" collection
    Then I should see text matching "Rohirrim make extraordinary deal"
    Then I should see text matching "Breaking: Gandalf supposedly plans his retirement"
    Then I should see text matching "Big hobbit feast - fireworks at midnight"

    # Test that unrelated content does not show up in the tiles.
    And I should not see the "Bilbo Baggins" tile
    # Test that the collection itself does not show up in the tiles.
    And I should not see the "Middle earth daily" tile

    # Test the filtering by facets.
    When I click the event content tab
    Then I should see text matching "Big hobbit feast - fireworks at midnight"
    Then I should not see text matching "Rohirrim make extraordinary deal"
    Then I should not see text matching "Breaking: Gandalf supposedly plans his retirement"
    When I click the news content tab
    Then I should not see text matching "Big hobbit feast - fireworks at midnight"
    Then I should see text matching "Rohirrim make extraordinary deal"
    Then I should see text matching "Breaking: Gandalf supposedly plans his retirement"
