Feature: SEO for news articles.
  As an owner of the website
  in order for my news to be better visible on the web
  I need proper metatag to be encapsulated in the html code.

  Scenario Outline: Basic metatags are attached as JSON schema on the page.
    Given collections:
      | title                       | state     |
      | Joinup SEO event collection | validated |
    And users:
      | Username          | E-mail                 | First name | Family name |
      | Joinup SEO author | joinup.seo@example.com | Patrick    | Stewart     |
    And "event" content:
      | title            | short title   | web url   | start date                      | end date                        | body                                               | logo     | agenda        | location   | online location                                          | organisation        | scope         | keywords | collection                  | state     |
      | Joinup SEO event | JOINUPSEO2020 | <web url> | Wed, 25 Dec 2019 13:00:00 +0100 | Wed, 01 Jan 2020 13:00:00 +0100 | summary: Summary of event. - value: Body of event. | logo.png | Event agenda. | <location> | 0: Some title - 1: http://example.com/some-online-meetup | European Commission | International | Alphabet | Joinup SEO event collection | validated |

    When I visit the "Joinup SEO event" event
    Then the metatag JSON should be attached in the page
    And 1 metatag graph of type "Event" should exist in the page
    And the metatag graph of the item with "name" "Joinup SEO event" should have the following properties:
      | property    | value                              |
      | @type       | Event                              |
      | name        | Joinup SEO event                   |
      # Though it would be nice to have this to the Joinup URL, Search Engines
      # expect this to be the URL of the event. If a website is provided, then
      # that means that the entity in Joinup is simply a promotion, and all the
      # handling of registrations etc, already has a website, thus we point to
      # that location.
      | url         | <expected url>                     |
      # Summary is preferred over the body of the entity.
      | description | Summary of event.                  |
      # The __timezone__ variable will allow any 2-digit number in the string. This is because of different timezones in
      # different environments.
      | startDate   | 2019-12-25T__timezone__:00:00+0100 |
      | endDate     | 2020-01-01T__timezone__:00:00+0100 |
      # __base_url__ will be replaced with the base url of the website.
      | @id         | <expected url>                     |
    And the metatag graph of the item with "name" "Joinup SEO event" should have the following "image" properties:
      | property             | value                                                |
      | @type                | ImageObject                                          |
      | representativeOfPage | True                                                 |
      # __random_text__ can be any string that is appointed by the system and we
      # cannot predict. In this case it is the random file name of the image.
      | url                  | __base_url__/sites/default/files/__random_text__.jpg |
      | width                | 377                                                  |
      | height               | 139                                                  |
    And the metatag graph of the item with "name" "Joinup SEO event" should have the following "location" properties:
      | property | value                                 |
      | @type    | Place                                 |
      | name     | <expected location>                   |
      | url      | http://example.com/some-online-meetup |
    # Target the location subgraph which has the name property set to "Rue
    # Belliard 28".
    And the metatag subgraph of the item with "name" "Rue Belliard 28" should have the following "address" properties:
      | property      | value               |
      | @type         | PostalAddress       |
      | streetAddress | <expected location> |
    And the metatag subgraph of the item with "name" "Rue Belliard 28" should have the following "geo" properties:
      | property  | value          |
      | @type     | GeoCoordinates |
      # Geo coordinates are hardcoded as offered by the service.
      | latitude  | 45.82372       |
      | longitude | 6.55121        |
    And the following meta tags should available in the html:
      | identifier      | value                                                                      |
      | description     | Summary of event.                                                          |

      | og:site_name    | Joinup                                                                     |
      | og:title        | Joinup SEO event                                                           |
      | og:description  | Summary of event.                                                          |
      | og:image        | __base_url__/sites/default/files/__random_text__.jpg                       |

      | og:image:width  | 377                                                                        |
      | og:image:height | 139                                                                        |

    When I click "Keep up to date"
    Then I should see the "Joinup SEO event" tile
    # No metatags are defined for the keep up to date page.
    # No metatags JSON in general means also that the entity metatags of the
    # news item is also not attached when the tile is present.
    And the metatag JSON should not be attached in the page

    Examples:
      | web url                                       | expected url                                                               | location                           | expected location |
      |                                               | __base_url__/collection/joinup-seo-event-collection/event/joinup-seo-event | Rue Belliard 28, Brussels, Belgium | Rue Belliard 28   |
      # Urls need a title value in the 0 index and a url in the 1 index of the
      # value to work, otherwise it is parsed wrongly.
      # @see: \Drupal\Driver\Fields\Drupal8\LinkHandler::expand
      | 0: Some url - 1: http://some-random-event-url | http://some-random-event-url                                               | Rue Belliard 28, Brussels, Belgium | Rue Belliard 28   |

  Scenario: Events without physical address but with online location should still show the online location.
    Given collections:
      | title                       | state     |
      | Joinup SEO event collection | validated |

      | Joinup SEO author | joinup.seo@example.com | Patrick    | Stewart     |
    And "event" content:
      | title            | short title   | online location                                          | collection                  | state     |
