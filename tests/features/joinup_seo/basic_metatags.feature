Feature:
  As the owner of the website
  In order for my site to be more appealing to the search engines
  I need to have basic metatags attached to the page.

  Scenario Outline: Front page metatags.
    Given I am <user type>
    When I am on the homepage
    Then the following meta tags should available in the html:
      | identifier    | value                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

    And the HTML title of the page should be "Joinup"

    When I click "Collections"
    Then the following meta tags should available in the html:
      | identifier    | value                                      |
      | og:url        | __base_url__/collections                   |
      | og:site_name  | Joinup                                     |
      | og:title      | Collections                                |
      | og:image      | __base_url__/themes/joinup/images/logo.svg |
      | og:image:type | image/svg+xml                              |

    Examples:
      | user type                                         |
      | an anonymous user                                 |
      | logged in as a user with the "authenticated" role |
