@api
Feature: SEO for news articles.
  As an owner of the website
  in order for my news to be better visible on the web
  I need proper metatag to be encapsulated in the html code.

  Scenario: Basic metatags are attached as JSON schema on the page.
    Given collections:
      | title                      | state     |
      | Joinup SEO news collection | validated |
    And users:
      | Username          | E-mail                 | First name | Family name |
      | Joinup SEO author | joinup.seo@example.com | Kurk       | Smith       |
    And "news" content:
      | title           | headline                    | logo     | body                                             | created                         | publication date                | changed                         | state     | author            | collection                 |
      | Joinup SEO news | Headline of Joinup SEO news | logo.png | summary: Summary of news. - value: Body of news. | Sun, 01 Dec 2019 13:00:00 +0100 | Wed, 25 Dec 2019 13:00:00 +0100 | Wed, 01 Jan 2020 13:00:00 +0100 | validated | Joinup SEO author | Joinup SEO news collection |

    When I visit the "Joinup SEO news" news
    Then the metatag JSON should be attached in the page
    And 1 metatag graph of type "NewsArticle" should exist in the page
    And the metatag graph of the item with "name" "Joinup SEO news" should have the following properties:
      | property            | value                                                                   |

      # The test files are assigned a random name so it is very hard to assert the real url. However, when the file is
      # found and added to the page, the dimensions are added as well. Asserting the dimensions also asserts the url in
      # a way.

    When I click "Keep up to date"
    Then I should see the "Joinup SEO news" tile
    # No metatags are defined for the keep up to date page.
    # No metatags JSON in general means also that the entity metatags of the news item
    # is also not attached when the tile is present.
    And the metatag JSON should not be attached in the page
