Feature: SEO for discussion forum posts.
  As an owner of the website
  in order for my discussions to be better visible on the web
  I need proper metatag to be encapsulated in the html code.

  Scenario: Basic metatags are attached as JSON schema on the page.
    Given collections:
      | title                            | state     |
      | Joinup SEO discussion collection | validated |
    And users:
      | Username          | E-mail                 | First name | Family name |
      | Joinup SEO author | joinup.seo@example.com | Kindle     | eReader     |
    And "discussion" content:
      | title                           | publication date                | changed                         | content                                                      | author            | attachments         | keywords                       | state     | collection                       |

    When I click "Keep up to date"
    Then I should see the "Discussions are now forum posts" tile
    # No metatags are defined for the keep up to date page.
    # No metatags JSON in general means also that the entity metatags of the
    # news item is also not attached when the tile is present.
    And the metatag JSON should not be attached in the page
