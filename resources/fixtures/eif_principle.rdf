    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The EIF is meant to be a generic framework applicable to all public administrations in
      the EU. It lays out the basic conditions for achieving interoperability, acting as the common denominator for
      relevant initiatives at all levels including European, national, regional and local, embracing public
      administrations, citizens and businesses. This document is addressed to all those involved in defining, designing,
      developing and delivering European public services.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The subsidiarity principle requires EU decisions to be taken as closely as possible
      to the citizen. The EU does not take action unless this is more effective than the same action taken at national
      level. The proportionality principle limits EU actions to what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the
      Treaties.

    <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">UP2</skos:altLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The concept of openness mainly relates to data, specifications and software. Open
      government data (here simply referred ‘open data’) refers to the idea that all public data should be freely
      available for use and reuse by others, unless restrictions apply e.g. for protection of personal data,
      confidentiality, or intellectual property rights. Public administrations collect and generate huge amounts of
      data. The Directive on the reuse of public sector information (PSI)7 encourages Member States to make public
      information available for access and reuse as open data. The INSPIRE Directive8 requires, in addition, sharing of
      spatial datasets and services between public authorities with no restrictions or practical obstacles to its reuse.
      This data should be published with as few restrictions as possible and clear licences for its use to allow better
      scrutiny of administrations’ decision-making processes and realise transparency in practice.

      administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and
      understand administrative rules, processes11, data, services and decision-making (2). Ensuring availability of
      interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often
      heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends
      on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability
      facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems. (3). Securing the
      right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of
      personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Interfaces, standards), information and data, is an enabler of interoperability and
      improves quality because it extends operational use, as well as saving money and time. This makes it a major
      contributor to the development of a digital single market in the EU. Some EU standards and specifications also
      exist in the DIFs and should be applied more widely. For example, the INSPIRE Directive sets out interoperability
      standards for addresses, cadastres, roads and many other data topics of relevance to many public administrations.
      These existing standards and specifications can and should be used more widely beyond the domain for which they
      were originally developed.

    <skos:definition>When establishing European public services, public administrations should focus on functional needs
      and defer decisions on technology as long as possible in order to minimise technological dependencies, to avoid
      imposing specific technical implementations or products on their constituents. Public administrations should
      provide for access and reuse of their public services and data irrespective of specific technologies or
      products.The functioning of the digital single market requires data to be easily transferable among different
      systems to avoid lock-in, support the free movement of data. This requirement relates to data portability - the
      ability to move and reuse data easily among different applications and systems, which becomes even more
      challenging in cross-border scenarios.

      service, is an important part of public service design, as users may prefer different channels depending on the
      circumstances and their needs; (2). A single point of contact should be made available to users, to hide internal
      administrative complexity and facilitate access to public services, e.g. when multiple bodies have to work
      together to provide a public service; (3). Users’ feedback should be systematically collected, assessed and used
      to design new public services and to further improve existing ones; (4). As far as possible, under the legislation
      in force, users should be able to provide data once only, and administrations should be able to retrieve and share
      this data to serve the user, in accordance with data protection rule (5). Users should be asked to provide only
      the information that is absolutely necessary to obtain a given public service.

    <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">UP9</skos:altLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">European public services can potentially be used by anyone in any Member State. So
      multilingualism needs to be carefully considered when designing them. Citizens across Europe often have problems
      in accessing and using digital public services if these are not available in the languages they speak. A balance
      needs to be found between the expectations of citizens and businesses to be served in their own language(s) or
      their preferred language(s) and the ability of Member States’ public administrations to offer services in all
      official EU languages. A suitable balance could be that European public services are available in the languages of
      the expected end-users, i.e. the number of languages is decided on the basis of users’ needs, such as the level to
      which the service is critical for the implementation of the digital single market or national policies, or the
      size of the relevant audience. Multilingualism comes into play not just in the user interface, but at all levels
      in the design of European public services. For example, the choices made on data representation in an electronic
      database should not limit its ability to support different languages.he multilingual aspect of interoperability
      becomes also relevant when a public service requires exchanges between information systems across language
      boundaries, as the meaning of the information exchanged must be preserved.

      administrative processes by improving them or eliminating any that does not provide public value. Administrative
      simplification can help businesses and citizens to reduce the administrative burden of complying with EU
      legislation or national obligations. Likewise, public administrations should introduce European public services
      supported by electronic means, including their interactions with other public administrations, citizens and
      businesses. Digitisation of public services should take place in accordance with the following concepts: (1).
      digital-by-default, whenever appropriate, so that there is at least one digital channel available for accessing
      and using a given European public service; (2). igital-first, which means that priority is given to using public
      services via digital channels while applying the multi-channel delivery concept and the no-wrong-door policy, i.e.
      physical and digital channels co-exist.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a
      specified time. This means that records18 and information in electronic form held by public administrations for
      the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new
      media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their
      legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy
      provisions. o guarantee the long-term preservation of electronic records and other kinds of information, formats
      should be chosen to ensure long-term accessibility, including preservation of associated electronic signatures or
      seals. In this regard, the use of qualified preservation services, in line with Regulation (EU) 910/2014, can
      ensure the long-term preservation of information. For information sources owned and managed by national
      administrations, preservation is a purely national matter. For information that is not strictly national,
      preservation becomes a European issue. In that case, an appropriate ‘preservation policy’ should be applied by the
      Member States concerned, to cope with any difficulties arising if the relevant information is used under different
      jurisdictions.
