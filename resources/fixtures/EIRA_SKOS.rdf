The Public Policy ABB  is salient for legal interoperability because it drives the production and formulation of legislation, and it is one of the main context elements to be taken into account when organisation need to work together, as stated in the EIF: &quot;Legal interoperability is about ensuring that organisations operating under different legal frameworks, policies and strategies are able to work together&quot;.

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):

Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
The common agricultural policy (CAP) – one of Europe’s oldest policies – has evolved along with the EU. Today&apos;s CAP supports a modern, market-oriented farming sector ensuring the provision of safe, affordable, high quality food, produced sustainably and respecting strict standards (environmental, animal welfare, food safety, etc.), as well as supporting investment in the broader rural economy.

        		<skos:definition xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION:
It is the specific set of decision making rules/criteria/principles followed at implementing a digital public services through organisations, persons, objects or events (Hill &amp; Hupe, 2002). In the MIS literature it is considered as the focus selected for the implementation (Hill &amp; Hupe, 2002; Marchand et al., 2000; Santosuosso &amp; Malerba, 2014).  The following implementation orientations are identified in the literature: integration, technology, governance and legal.

•	The INTEGRATION ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on data resources and on information management capabilities to manage information resources over their life cycle (i.e. scanning, collecting, organising, processing, maintaining, etc.) to understand societal needs, to embed data throughout the policy cycle, and to develop a culture of data analytics (OECD, 2018). The integration orientation will be based on semantic interoperability aiming for the design of a shared knowledge base of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables:
i)	structural interoperability by using and/or sharing of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge (i.e. data set catalogue, base registries, catalogue of ontologies); 
ii)	behavioural interoperability by exchanging capabilities of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge with the environment (i.e. representation, data mappings); and
iii)	governance interoperability by semantic interoperability agreements (i.e. ontologies).  

•	The TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on ICT resources like solutions and infrastructure and on ICT management capabilities to manage the provision of services (i.e. business operations, decision making, internal support, etc.) to users and the consumption of services by ministries and agencies (OECD, 2018). The technology orientation will be based on technical interoperability aiming for the design of a shared platform of ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables:
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of software components (i.e. service registry service, networks, reusable building blocks, common [back office] services);
ii) behavioural interoperability with ICT exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. intermediation services, interfaces); an
iii) governance interoperability with technical interoperability agreements (i.e. protocols, choreography rules).

•	The GOVERNANCE ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on the governance resources (Grant et al., 2007) and on governance management capabilities/archetypes to manage the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) for the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) to achieve a more agile, effective, and digitally inclusive public engagement, to increase trust in government, and to enhance government transparency (OECD, 2018; Weill &amp; Woodham, 2002). The governance orientation will be based on organisational interoperability aiming for the design of a shared governance framework of [re]usable organisational resources that enables:
i)	structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogue);
ii)	behavioural interoperability with organisational exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. service delivery model); and
iii)	governance interoperability with organisational interoperability agreements (i.e. service level agreements, governance structures).

•	The LEGAL ORIENTATION (Santosuossa and Malerba, 2014) is characterized by a focus on legal and regulatory frameworks based in displayed leadership and political commitment to ensure adaptation to rapidly changing technological and diverse social environments with high-level requirements to achieve coherence and effective support to digital public services implementation (OECD, 2018). The legal orientation will be based in legal interoperability aiming for the design of a shared legal framework of [re]usable legal resources that enables:
i)	structural interoperability by legislation on reusing and/or sharing orientation and guidelines (i.e. legislation catalogue, interoperability reference architectures);
ii)	behavioural interoperability by legislation on exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. interoperability frameworks); and
iii)	governance interoperability by legislation on governance agreements (i.e. GDPR).

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Behavioural IoP
The Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation ABB is salient for organizational interoperability because the extent of support to the public policy goals by a digital interoperable public service might be influenced by the selected implementation orientation.

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Governance IoP
The Public Policy Cycle ABB is salient for legal interoperability because it impacts the design and formulation of public policies, which are implemented through legal acts. Interoperability principles need to be taken into account during the whole public policy cycle.

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):

Performance-based Full Policy Cycle for the Digital Single Market 
The key features of a performance-based full policy cycle are a clear articulation of policy objectives, the identification and use of quantitative indicators of expected short-term and longer-term policy impacts, the identification of synergies between policies, a much greater use of quantitative data in ex-ante impact assessments, the implementation of robust, data-based, independent ex post assessments of the performance of policies relative to their expected impacts and a wide dissemination of lessons learned in such ex-post performance assessments.

•	directives: these bind the EU countries as to the results to be achieved; they have to be transposed into the national legal framework and thus leave margin for manoeuvre as to the form and means of implementation;
•	decisions: these are fully binding on those to whom they are addressed.

Based on EUR-Lex
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/community_legal_instruments.html 

The binding legal instruments that make up the secondary legislation of the EU are Regulations, Directives and Decisions.  As set out in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union:
- A Regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in
all Member States.
- A Directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is
addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.
- A Decision shall be binding in its entirety. A Decision which specifies those to whom it is addressed
shall be binding only on them.

Decision No 922/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on interoperability solutions for European public administrations (ISA)	
	1.	This Decision establishes, for the period 2010-2015, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, including local and regional administrations and Community institutions and bodies, providing common and 		shared solutions facilitating interoperability (the ISA programme).
	2.	The objective of the ISA programme is to support cooperation between European public administrations by facilitating the efficient and effective electronic cross-border and cross-sectoral interaction between such administrations, including 		bodies performing public functions on their behalf, enabling the delivery of electronic public services supporting the implementation of Community policies and activities.

Legal means, involving no obligation, which are available to the European institutions to carry out their tasks. The European non-binding, declaratory instruments listed in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are recommendations and opinions:
•	Recommendations are non-mandatory acts issued by the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, or the European Central Bank which suggest a certain form of conduct to those to whom they are addressed without imposing any legal obligations.
•	Opinions are non-binding legal acts adopted by the European institutions which do not bind those to whom they are addressed.

Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also provides for non binding legal instruments.
- Recommendations call upon the party to whom they are addressed to behave in a particular way without placing them under any legal obligation
- Opinions issued by the EU institutions give assessments of situations or developments in the Union or in the individual Member States. They may also also prepare the way for subsequent, legally binding acts, or be a prerequisite for the institution of proceedings before the Court of Justice
Recommendations and Opinions have moral and political significance, without being legally binding
The three other main forms of actions that shape the EU legal order without having legally binding effect are Resolutions, Declarations and Action programmes.

Action Plan for the future of Organic Production in the European Union
The Commission launched a consultation for the review of the European policy on organic agriculture in 2012-2013. This consultation has also been an opportunity to consult experts, stakeholders and the public on areas where a new action plan might be needed. To help organic farmers, producers and retailers adjust to the proposed policy changes and meet future challenges, the Commission has also approved an Action Plan on the future of Organic Production in Europe. The Plan foresees to better inform farmers on rural development and EU farm policy initiatives encouraging organic farming, to strengthen links between EU research and innovation projects and organic production and to encourage the use of organic food, e.g. in schools.

Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data
The Regulation, applicable as of 28 May 2019, aims at removing obstacles to the free movement of non-personal data across Member States and IT systems in Europe.
The Regulation ensures:
- Free movement of non-personal data across borders: every organisation should be able to store and process data anywhere in the European Union,
- The availability of data for regulatory control: public authorities will retain access to data, also when it is located in another Member State or when it is stored or processed in the cloud,
- Easier switching of cloud service providers for professional users. The Commission has started facilitating self-regulation in this area, encouraging providers to develop codes of conduct regarding the conditions under which users can port data between cloud service providers and back into their own IT environments,
- Full consistency and synergies with the cybersecurity package, and clarification that any security requirements that already apply to businesses storing and processing data will continue to do so when they store or process data across borders in the EU or in the cloud.

The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF)
The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.
It offers public administrations 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. 
The new EIF is undertaken in the context of the Commission priority to create a Digital Single Market in Europe. The public sector, which accounts for over a quarter of total employment and represents approximately a fifth of the EU’s GDP through public procurement, plays a key role in the Digital Single Market as a regulator, services provider and employer.
The successful implementation of the EIF will improve the quality of European public services and will create an environment where public administrations can collaborate digitally.

The Security Framework ABB  is salient for interoperability because &quot;security and privacy are primary concerns in the provision of public services&quot; (EIF) and, as stated in EIF Recommendation 15: &quot;Define a common security and privacy framework and establish processes for public services to ensure secure and trustworthy data exchange between public administrations and in interactions with citizens and businesses.&quot;

EXAMPLES:

The EU cybersecurity certification framework
The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation.
On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the &quot;&quot;EU Cybersecurity Agency&quot;&quot;, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (&apos;&apos;Cybersecurity Act&apos;&apos;).
Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market.
The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards.
The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service.
The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;

An individual is a principal that provides and/or consumes Public Services. A citizen is a member of a particular country and who has rights because of being born there or because of being given rights.
Every national of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to national citizenship and shall not replace it (Treaty of Maastricht on European Union, Title II Provisions on democratic principles, article 8).
The main difference between the two (European citizenship and citizenship of a Member State) is that the rights that citizens enjoy as a result of European citizenship are not matched with duties. Legal basis: Articles 9 to 12 TEU and 18 to 25 TFEU (European Parliament).
The additional rights EU citizenship confers are detailed at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/index_en.htm (European Commission).

Ecolabel - Member State Competent Body 
The Competent Body is the independent organisation responsible for assessing, awarding, and managing EU Ecolabel applications and licences on the national level. The Competent Body provides guidance on the documents needed for the dossier, such as declarations, data sheets, and test results. Recommendations on product testing laboratories that are ISO 17025 accredited or equivalent are shared, along with any relevant technical expertise needed to complete the application.
Upon application approval, the Competent Body issues the contract and licence upon approving the application. This contract sets out the services or range of products covered within the licence, including any trade names or manufacturer’s internal reference numbers. It will also lay out the terms of use of the EU Ecolabel, following the standard contract in Annex IV of the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of 25 November 2009. Once the contract has been signed, a certificate can be asked for/will be sent, depending on the Competent Body. This certificate will detail: the licence number that can be used with the EU Ecolabel logo; the legal name of the applicant; the services or range of products awarded the EU Ecolabel; all relevant trade names under which the product is sold or the service is marketed. The Competent Body will give the final validation on when the EU Ecolabel logo and the licence number can be used on the EU Ecolabel services and products that have met the criteria.

EU SCIENCE HUB - The European Commission&apos;s science and knowledge service - JRC&apos;s Data policy	
The JRC&apos;s data policy is driven by transparency with the aim of contributing to innovation. It is a pillar of the development and implementation of scientific knowledge management at the JRC. It follows the commitments and regulatory basis of the Commission Decision on the reuse of Commission documents (2011/833/EU).

The objectives for adopting and implementing the JRC data policy include:

•	Share and use data on the basis of the JRC Open Data principles: fully, freely, openly and timely;
•	To be transparent on the reasons for restricted access to certain data;
•	Provide a coordinated approach to the acquisition of data by the JRC;
•	Facilitate management, broaden access and use of JRC data;
•	Reinforce goals of Horizon 2020;
•	Support EU implementation of the G8 Open Data Charter;
•	Continuously support evidence-based decision making and research;
•	Ensure that JRC data is made available through the EU Open Data Portal.

For a successful implementation process, the JRC&apos;s data policy lays down implementation principles with respect to responsible entities, overall implementation guidelines, and their individual elements like data management plans, as well as the monitoring of its implementation.

European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) is a self-declaration of the businesses&apos; financial status, abilities and suitability for a public procurement procedure. It is available in all EU languages and used as a preliminary evidence of fulfilment of the conditions required in public procurement procedures across the EU. Thanks to the ESPD, the tenderers no longer have to provide full documentary evidence and different forms previously used in the EU procurement, which means a significant simplification of access to cross-border tendering opportunities. [...] The online form can be filled in, printed and then sent to the buyer together with the rest of the bid.

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in resource description. The name &quot;Dublin&quot; is due to its origin at a 1995 invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio; &quot;core&quot; because its elements are broad and generic, usable for describing a wide range of resources.
The fifteen element &quot;Dublin Core&quot; described in this standard is part of a larger set of metadata vocabularies and technical specifications maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). The full set of vocabularies, DCMI Metadata Terms [DCMI-TERMS], also includes sets of resource classes (including the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE]), vocabulary encoding schemes, and syntax encoding schemes. The terms in DCMI vocabularies are intended to be used in combination with terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles and on the basis of the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM].

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Governance IoP 
The Base Registry Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because base registries include &quot;authorative sources of information&quot;, that need to be properly governed and made available. EIF&apos;s includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as &quot;the cornerstone of European public service delivery&quot;. EIF gives several recommendations on how to manage and interact with base registries (recommendation 37, 38, 39 and 40).

GOOD PRACTICES ON BUILDING SUCESSFUL INTERCONNECTIONS OF BASE REGISTRIES
In order to provide quick and user-friendly public services to citizens and businesses, public administrations are trying to adopt customer-centric approaches and readjust their ways of working.
One way to achieve efficiency and increase user-friendliness is through the ‘once-only principle’. Instead of asking the citizen for information that they have already provided, public administrations will reuse the information they already have. Much of this information is stored in authoritative databases called base registries. As the authentic sources of data for public administrations, base registries are one of the basic building blocks of public services and are the key to making the once-only principle a reality.
The document contains some good practices to foster access to the data contained in these base registries.
The good practices presented, are grouped according to the layered interoperability model proposed by the European Interoperability
Framework (EIF).

The data portability policy implements the right to data portability, which is one of eight rights enforced by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It regulates the exchange of data, allowing data subjects to obtain data that a data controller holds on them and to reuse it for their own purposes. 
Accourding to GDPR, Individuals are free to either store the data for personal use or to transmit it to another data controller. The data must be received “in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format”.

According to the Article 29 of the Data Protection Working Party (WP29), an advisory body made up of representatives from each EU member state, this right “support[s] the free flow of personal data in the EU and foster[s] competition between controllers”.
The right to data portability applies:
- To personal data that an individual has given to a data controller;
- When the processing is carried out by automated means; and
- Where the processing is based on the individual’s consent or for the performance or a contract.

EURES - Job vacancy
Most of the jobs on the EURES Job Mobility Portal come from the job vacancies databases managed by the Public Employment Services of the countries participating in EURES. Using a technology called Web Services, the EURES search engine instantly, in real time, interrogates each national database for jobs. These jobs can be of two types:
“EURES jobs&quot;, displayed with a blue flag, which are jobs where an employer has expressed an interest in recruiting from another country, or any other jobs advertised in the national jobs databases.
There is, in addition, a central database where EURES advisers can manually post jobs that will all be flagged as &quot;EURES jobs&quot;. This is for the time being the only way for those few countries that are not yet fully connected to Web Services to advertise jobs on the EURES portal. This solution can, however, also be used for other specific purposes, such as when an employer wishes to publish a vacancy in several languages etc., which may not always be possible in a national database.

ISA2 Core Vocabularies

Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. 
Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:
•	Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.
•	Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.
•	Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources and create a data mash-up.
•	Open data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and service portals. 
•	ISA² has developed the Core Vocabularies for public administrations in an open process with the active involvement of specific working groups. The Core Vocabularies developed are the following:
-	Core Person: captures the fundamental characteristics of a person, e.g. name, gender, date of birth, location.
-	Registered organisation: captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity (e.g. its identifier, activities) which is created through a formal registration process, typically in a national or regional register.
-	Core Location: captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name or geometry.
-	Core Public service: captures the fundamental characteristics of a service offered by a public administration.
-	Core Criterion and Core Evidence: describe the principles and the means that a private entity must fulfil to become eligible or qualified to perform public services. A Criterion is a rule or a principle that is used to judge, evaluate or test something. An Evidence is a means to prove a Criterion.
-	Core Public organisation: describes public organisations in the European Union.

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Structural IoP, Behavioral IoP, Governance IoP
The Data Model ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it ensures compatible interpretations of data exchange as specified in the document &quot;Methodology and tools for metadata governance and management for EU Institutions&quot;, developed under the SEMIC action of the ISA Programme: &quot;Whilst technological developments offer various means to automate the exchange of information, technological developments alone cannot guarantee a greater interoperability between information systems. A fundamental aspect is the need for common data standards: primarily data models and reference data [...]&quot;.

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): 

ESPD - Exchange data model 
The ESPD exchange data model (ESPD-EDM) is used for the ESPD service provided by the European Commission.
The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on &quot;the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7&quot;), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].
One premise that has ruled the design and implementation life-cycle of the ESPD-EDM has been &apos;&apos;not to reinvent the wheel&apos;&apos;. Thus some very early key decisions were: 

(i)	select a mature business language for the naming, design and implementation of the ESPD-EDM; 
(ii)	reuse as much as possible existing information components and libraries &apos;&apos;as-they-are&apos;&apos;; 
(iii)	for those entities that are not defined in any standard specification, design new components in such a way that they can be reused in other situations and domains, both in e-Procurement and beyond e-Procurement.

OASIS UBL-2.1 standard was chosen as the best candidate to base the ESPD-EDM upon. The main reasons for this decisions were: 
i.	The European Commission is already using (and recommending) UBL-2.1 for e-Documents.[5] ; 
ii.	Most of the concepts and components necessary for the ESPD documents were already defined by UBL specifically for e-Procurement; (3) Methodology and tools are available for the development of new documents, the extension of the existing UBL libraries, the semantic validation of XML instances, etc.

GrapesJS
GrapesJS is an open-source, multi-purpose, Web Builder Framework which combines different tools and features with the goal to help you (or users of your application) to build HTML templates without any knowledge of coding. It&apos;s a perfect solution to replace the common WYSIWYG editors, which are good for content editing but inappropriate for creating HTML structures. You can see it in action with the official demos, but using its API you&apos;re able to build your own editors.

eDelivery
Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents
eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission&apos;s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.

Hibernate Validator
Express validation rules in a standardized way using annotation-based constraints and benefit from transparent integration with a wide variety of frameworks.
Application layer agnostic validation: Hibernate Validator allows to express and validate application constraints. The default metadata source are annotations, with the ability to override and extend through the use of XML. It is not tied to a specific application tier or programming model and is available for both server and client application programming.
Hibernate Validator presents the following characteristics:

•	Extendable: Hibernate Validator offers a configurable bootstrap API as well as a range of built-in constraints. The latter can easily be extended by creating custom constraints.
•	Rich metadata API: Hibernate Validator gives access to constraint configuration via a metadata API facilitating, for example, tooling integration.
•	Reference implementation: Hibernate Validator 6.x is the reference implementation Bean Validation 2.0.
•	Added value: Hibernate Validator offers additional value on top of the features required by Bean Validation. For example, a programmatic constraint configuration API as well as an annotation processor which plugs into the build process and raises compilation errors whenever constraint annotations are incorrectly used.

Consul
Consul has multiple components, but as a whole, it is a tool for discovering and configuring services in an infrastructure. It provides several key features:

•	Service Discovery: Clients of Consul can provide a service, such as api or mysql, and other clients can use Consul to discover providers of a given service. Using either DNS or HTTP, applications can easily find the services they depend upon.
•	Health Checking: Consul clients can provide any number of health checks, either associated with a given service (&quot;is the webserver returning 200 OK&quot;), or with the local node (&quot;is memory utilization below 90%&quot;). This information can be used by an operator to monitor cluster health, and it is used by the service discovery components to route traffic away from unhealthy hosts.
•	KV Store: Applications can make use of Consul&apos;s hierarchical key/value store for any number of purposes, including dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election, and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use.
•	Multi Datacenter: Consul supports multiple datacenters out of the box. This means users of Consul do not have to worry about building additional layers of abstraction to grow to multiple regions.

Activiti
Activiti is an open-source workflow engine written in Java that can execute business processes described in BPMN 2.0. Activiti supports open standards such as BPMN and DMN with open REST APIs for demanding human- and system-centric processes. It provides business intelligence and audit logs features for free.  And with building the solution on business processes, Activiti help to structure the software, think about user tasks, external systems and timers that need to be managed, think about transaction boundaries of the application. Building that kind of features becomes easier when structuring an application around a business process. Managing wait states, timers and asynchronous continuations becomes easier. A business process can express that structure more compact than working with the fundamental instruments that the Java platform offers like JDBC and JMS. Activiti also makes possible to link in Java or scripting for jobs.

Shares the functionality of verifying that several solutions can interoperate at one or more layers of the interoperability stack, while conforming to one or more specifications. This type of testing is executed by operating SUTs (System Under Test) and capturing their exchanges.
The logistics of interoperability testing is usually more costly (time, coordination, interoperability), and interoperability testing is no substitute for a conformance test suite. Experience shows that interoperability testing is more successful and less costly when conformance of implementations has been tested first.

SoapUI
SoapUI is the world&apos;s most widely-used open source API testing tool for SOAP and REST APIs. SoapUI offers SOAP Web Services functional testing, REST API functional testing, WSDL coverage, message assertion testing and test refactoring. 
Scenario-based tests should be directly tied to user stories, which were probably provided by the product owner or some business stakeholder. Under ideal circumstances, these tests should be the user stories, so that business stakeholders can both easily help the tester develop the test cases and understand the results.

Form Tools
Form Tools is a forms framework written in PHP and MySQL. You download and install the script on your own website. At its heart, Form Tools is a web form creator, processor, data storage and access script. It was originally designed to work with any existing web form, but has since been expanded to create forms automatically as well.
Form Tools is extremely versatile in how it integrates with your forms. You can use the bundled Form Builder module to create the forms automatically on your website (no programming or HTML skills necessary); you can use the PHP API to integrate your own custom form with the script; or you can simply POST your form to Form Tools, and just use it to store the form data. Anything goes! You can read about the different integration methods / form creation methods here.
Form Tools works by creating custom database tables to store your unique form data. It provides a range of functionality customized to your data set, such as allowing you to view, update, cross-reference and export your submission data, create subsets of your data for viewing/editing by client accounts, data visualizations, and much more.

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Behavioral IoP
The Data Pubblication Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides the functionalities to make public data freely available for use and reuse by others unless restriction aoply as stated in the EIF recommendation n.2: &quot;Publish the data you own as open data unless certain restrictions apply.&quot;

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):
European Data Portal 
The European Data Portal harvests the metadata of Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries. Information regarding the provision of data and the benefits of re-using data is also included.
What is Open Data?
-	Open (Government) Data refers to the information collected, produced or paid for by the public bodies (also referred to as Public Sector Information) and made freely available for re-use for any purpose. The licence will specify the terms of use. 
-	Public sector information is information held by the public sector. The Directive on the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data. It is built around the key pillars of the internal market: free flow of data, transparency and fair competition. It is important to note that not all of the public sector information is Open Data.
Within the Portal, sections are dedicated to:
-	Searching datasets: Categories have been established to structure the metadata harvested from the various countries. These categories follow the revision of the DCAT Application Profile and have been mapped against the Eurovoc Thesaurus.
-	Providing Data: This section gives an insight into understanding Open Data from the perspective of a data provider. In addition, instructions are offered for those who wish their data portal to be harvested by the European Data Portal.
-	Using Data: How Open Data is being used, as well as the economic benefits of Open Data are detailed in this section.
-	Training and Library: eLearning modules about Open Data as well as training guides and a knowledge base referencing publications around Open Data and featured projects.
Portals can be national, regional, local or domain specific. They cover the 28 EU Member States, EEA, countries involved in the EU&apos;s neighbourhood policy and Switzerland.
https://www.europeandataportal.eu/   

Belgian Data Portal
The Belgian Data Portal provides data (more than 6500 datasets), tools and resources.
Open Data is a driver for innovation, economic growth, transparency and participation. According to a European study (ref.COM (2011) 882) the cumulative economic benefits arising from the provision of public data would amount to € 40 billion per year in the EU. These data lend themselves to reuse in the context of new products and services and can improve the efficiency of public authorities. Making public sector data accessible makes it possible to involve citizens more in political and social life and to make an active contribution to policy areas such as the environment, mobility, the economy, and so on.
The 2014-2018 Belgian government agreement states that the government will focus on opening public sector data (Open Data policy). Open public data is now the rule. Public services make available to citizens, researchers, companies and public authorities the reuse of data already available to them in the framework of their missions.
It is more specifically data that:
-	Public services have collected as part of their data collection missions;
-	Do not contain (more) privacy-sensitive information that is not protected by intellectual property rights held by third parties;
-	Are published in a format that is easy to reuse automatically (&quot;machine readable &quot;);
-	Can be reused for commercial and non-commercial purposes.
It is not only a matter of making public service data available, but also of building a community environment around these data. Companies can reuse some data and enrich it with their own information to market new products and services. Citizens benefit from more transparent public authorities and public services can help improve the quality of existing public data and services.

CKAN 
CKAN is a data management system that makes data accessible by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data.
This is a tool for making open data websites. It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data.
Once your data is published, users can use its faceted search features to browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and tables – whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens, or even your own staff.
CKAN is open source and free software, with an active community of contributors who develop and maintain its core technology. CKAN is modified and extended by an even larger community of developers who contribute to a growing library of CKAN extensions.

Globus
Globus is a leading provider of research data management software application and platform services.
Globus publication capabilities are delivered through a hosted service. Published data is stored on campus, institutional, and group resources that are often managed and operated by different administrators. To associate storage resources with a data collection simply use Globus shared endpoints and associate them with the data repository to publish. Published datasets are organized by &quot;communities&quot; and their member &quot;collections&quot;. Globus users can create and manage their own communities and collections through the data publication service. A collection enables the submission of datasets with policies regarding access.
A dataset comprises data and metadata. Policies can be set on communities or collections to manage:
-	Metadata (schema, requirements)
-	Access control (user and group based)
-	Curation workflow
-	Submission and distribution licenses
-	Storage
Datasets undergo curation based on a workflow defined by the community that will publish the data. Workflows may be customized by each community to capture their specific metadata and to reflect the community&apos;s review process. After the dataset is published, it is discoverable using a faceted search that allows the researcher to progressively filter results and rapidly focus in on the data of interest. The data may then be transferred to a Globus endpoint where the investigator can inspect and further process the data.
Data publication is a premium feature available with a Globus Subscription

Introducing OpenACH, the world&apos;s first free, open-source, secure web-based ACH origination and payment processing platform. 
ACH stands for &quot;Automated Clearing House&quot; and is a term that can be used very loosely in the banking and business industries. An originator is a business or organization initiating a transaction, either credit or debit. 
OpenACH is several things:
-	An open source (GPLv3) ACH payment platform, written in PHP using Postgresql
-	An easy to use ACH payment gateway, using REST and JSON to put payments on the ACH network
-	A BYOB (Bring Your Own Bank) ACH processing platform
-	A third-party ACH originator, processing your payments on your behalf

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):

Apache ZooKeeper
Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.
ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.
ZooKeeper aims at distilling the essence of these different services into a very simple interface to a centralized coordination service. The service itself is distributed and highly reliable. Consensus, group management, and presence protocols will be implemented by the service so that the applications do not need to implement them on their own. Application specific uses of these will consist of a mixture of specific components of Zoo Keeper and application specific conventions. ZooKeeper Recipes shows how this simple service can be used to build much more powerful abstractions.
Apache have Java and C interfaces to Zoo Keeper for the applications themselves. A variety of client bindings is available for a number of languages including Python, Ruby and Go.

DigiStamp eTimeStamp® protects the intellectual property in any computer file:
•	Use Desktop and Web applications for on-demand protection
•	Plug the Timestamp Authority into the automated systems
Plug-in rigorous implementation of US &amp; EU standards:
•	Secure, reliable, RFC 3161 timestamp cloud service
•	Archiving and Hash Chaining keyless security
•	Elliptic Curve Upgrade
Implementation of the Internet Engineering Task Force&apos;s RFC 3161 means DigiStamp timestamps are understood by data validation systems the world over:
•	Implementation of ANSI X9.95 further increases the compatibility of our timestamps.
•	Compliance with IETF RFC 3628 gives credence to the trustworthiness of our Time Stamp Authorities.
•	Conformance to IETF RFC 3126 makes our timestamps usable for long-term, legally binding agreements.
https://www.digistamp.com/ 

freeTSA.org offers free NTP and DNSCRYPT services
freeTSA.org provides a free Time Stamp Authority. Adding a trusted timestamp to code or to an electronic signature provides a digital seal of data integrity and a trusted date and time of when the transaction took place.
Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification times of a document. Security here means that no one - not even the owner of the document - should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper&apos;s integrity is never compromised. FreeTSA trusted timestamping Software as a Service (SaaS) provides an easy method to apply RFC 3161 trusted timestamps to time-sensitive transactions through independently verified and auditable date and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) sources.

Trusted lists of all EU Member States
EU Member States have the obligation to establish, maintain and publish trusted lists of qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services provided by them.
Under the Regulation (EC) No 910/2014/EU (eIDAS Regulation), national Trusted Lists have a constitutive effect. In other words, a trust service provider and the trust services it provides will be qualified only if it appears in the Trusted Lists. Consequently, the users (citizens, businesses or public administrations) will benefit from the legal effect associated with a given qualified trust service only if the latter is listed (as qualified) in the Trusted Lists.
Article 22 of the eIDAS Regulation provides indeed the obligation for Member States to establish, maintain and publish trusted lists, including information related to the qualified trust service providers for which they are responsible, together with information related to the qualified trust services provided by them. The lists are to be published in a secured manner, electronically signed or sealed in a form suitable for automated processing.
Trusted Lists are therefore essential in ensuring certainty and building trust among market operators as they indicate the status of the service provider and of the service at the moment of supervision, while aiming at fostering interoperability of qualified trust services by facilitating the validation of, among others, eSignatures and eSeals.
Member States may add trust services other than the qualified ones in the trusted lists, on a voluntary basis, at national level, provided that it is clearly indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.
In order to allow access to the trusted lists of all Member States, the Commission makes them available to the public, through a secure channel to an authenticated web server, the trusted lists as notified by Member States, in a signed or sealed form suitable for automated processing.

Hosts within enterprises that use IP can be partitioned into two categories:
Category 1: hosts that do not require access to hosts in other enterprises or the Internet at large; hosts within this category may use IP addresses that are unambiguous within an enterprise, but may be ambiguous between enterprises.
Category 2: hosts that need access to a limited set of outside services (e.g., E-mail, FTP, netnews, remote login) which can be handled by mediating gateways (e.g., application layer gateways). For any hosts in this category an unrestricted external access (provided via IP connectivity) may be unnecessary and even undesirable for privacy/security reasons. Just like hosts within the first category, such hosts may use IP addresses that are unambiguous within an enterprise, but may be ambiguous between enterprises.
A third category is what is called a &apos;public network’ and consist of the following:
Category 3: hosts that need network layer access outside the enterprise (provided via IP connectivity); hosts in the last category require IP addresses that are globally unambiguous.

DIRECTIVE 2014/24/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC (Text with EEA relevance). The directive sets out rules on the use of public contracts for the provision of works, supplies or services by companies or individuals and the exemptions which can be applied. The legislation specifies that when national authorities use public procurement to invite tenders to provide works, supplies or services, they must treat all applicants equally and not discriminate between them. They must also be transparent in their dealings. This Directive is considered as a Legal Interoperability Specification, as it shall be transposed in a National or Regional Binding Instrument when designing the solution using the e-procurement Solution Architecture Template.

Semantic interoperability enables organisations to process information from external sources in a meaningful manner. It ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understood and preserved throughout exchanges between parties. In the context of the EIF, semantic interoperability encompasses the following aspects:
•	Semantic interoperability is about the meaning of data elements and the relationship between them. It includes developing vocabulary to describe data exchanges, and ensures that data elements are understood in the same way by communicating parties.
•	Syntactic interoperability is about describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar, format and schemas.
Semantic interoperability specifications support semantic interoperability by addressing the core semantic interoperability background for solutions.

        		<skos:definition xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[DESCRIPTION:
It is the specific set of decision making rules/criteria/principles followed at implementing a digital public services through organisations, persons, objects or events (Hill &amp; Hupe, 2002). In the MIS literature it is considered as the focus selected for the implementation (Hill &amp; Hupe, 2002; Marchand et al., 2000; Santosuosso &amp; Malerba, 2014).  The following implementation orientations are identified in the literature: integration, technology, governance and legal.

•	The INTEGRATION ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on data resources and on information management capabilities to manage information resources over their life cycle (i.e. scanning, collecting, organising, processing, maintaining, etc.) to understand societal needs, to embed data throughout the policy cycle, and to develop a culture of data analytics (OECD, 2018). The integration orientation will be based on semantic interoperability aiming for the design of a shared knowledge base of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables:
i)	structural interoperability by using and/or sharing of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge (i.e. data set catalogue, base registries, catalogue of ontologies); 
ii)	behavioural interoperability by exchanging capabilities of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge with the environment (i.e. representation, data mappings); and
iii)	governance interoperability by semantic interoperability agreements (i.e. ontologies).  

•	The TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on ICT resources like solutions and infrastructure and on ICT management capabilities to manage the provision of services (i.e. business operations, decision making, internal support, etc.) to users and the consumption of services by ministries and agencies (OECD, 2018). The technology orientation will be based on technical interoperability aiming for the design of a shared platform of ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables:
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of software components (i.e. service registry service, networks, reusable building blocks, common [back office] services);
ii) behavioural interoperability with ICT exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. intermediation services, interfaces); an
iii) governance interoperability with technical interoperability agreements (i.e. protocols, choreography rules).

•	The GOVERNANCE ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on the governance resources (Grant et al., 2007) and on governance management capabilities/archetypes to manage the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) for the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) to achieve a more agile, effective, and digitally inclusive public engagement, to increase trust in government, and to enhance government transparency (OECD, 2018; Weill &amp; Woodham, 2002). The governance orientation will be based on organisational interoperability aiming for the design of a shared governance framework of [re]usable organisational resources that enables:
i)	structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogue);
ii)	behavioural interoperability with organisational exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. service delivery model); and
iii)	governance interoperability with organisational interoperability agreements (i.e. service level agreements, governance structures).

•	The LEGAL ORIENTATION (Santosuossa and Malerba, 2014) is characterized by a focus on legal and regulatory frameworks based in displayed leadership and political commitment to ensure adaptation to rapidly changing technological and diverse social environments with high-level requirements to achieve coherence and effective support to digital public services implementation (OECD, 2018). The legal orientation will be based in legal interoperability aiming for the design of a shared legal framework of [re]usable legal resources that enables:
i)	structural interoperability by legislation on reusing and/or sharing orientation and guidelines (i.e. legislation catalogue, interoperability reference architectures);
ii)	behavioural interoperability by legislation on exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. interoperability frameworks); and
iii)	governance interoperability by legislation on governance agreements (i.e. GDPR).

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Behavioural IoP
The Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation ABB is salient for organizational interoperability because the extent of support to the public policy goals by a digital interoperable public service might be influenced by the selected implementation orientation.

The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):

1.	A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges, by promoting research into their causes, their transmission and their prevention, as well as health information and education, and monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. The Union shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention.
2.	The Union shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas referred to in this Article and, if necessary, lend support to their action. It shall in particular encourage cooperation between the Member States to improve the complementarity of their health services in cross-border areas. Member States shall, in liaison with the Commission, coordinate among themselves their policies and programmes in the areas referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed.
3.	The Union and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of public health.
4.	By way of derogation from Article 2(5) and Article 6(a) and in accordance with Article 4(2)(k) the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in this Article through adopting in order to meet common safety concerns: (a) measures setting high standards of quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, blood and blood derivatives; these measures shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures; (b) measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which have as their direct objective the protection of public health; (c) measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use.
5.	The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, may also adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health and in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health, and measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco and the abuse of alcohol, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States.
6.	The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in this Article.
7.	Union action shall respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.

EUCARIS - registry network
EUCARIS is an initiative of several European countries and can be described as a cooperation between several national registration authorities. Formalised in a multilateral treaty, this cooperation is focused on the data-exchange regarding vehicle registration, driving licences, and the accompanying personal data. For this exchange, a system is used which was especially developed for this purpose: EUCARIS II. It is essential to note that EUCARIS makes no use of a central European database. Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their national registration authority other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The national registration authority becomes a central hub in EUCARIS.

To be of any use in computers, in computer communications and in particular on the World Wide Web, characters must be encoded. In fact, much of the information processed by computers over the last few decades has been encoded text, exceptions being images, audio, video and numeric data. To achieve text encoding, a large variety of character encodings have been devised. Character encodings can loosely be explained as mappings between the character sequences that users manipulate and the sequences of bits that computers manipulate.

Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8)

ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8.
UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.
UTF-8 has a one-octet encoding unit.  It uses all bits of an octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII [US-ASCII] range: US-ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for a US-ASCII character, and nothing else.
UTF-8 encodes UCS characters as a varying number of octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on the integer value assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number, a.k.a. code position, code point or Unicode scalar value).

UUID
A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. Since a UUID is a fixed size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to rollover.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit sequence to a string representation. Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values "a" through "f" are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.

Open Contracting Data Standard schema-level mapping - Template and guidance
This guide details an example of using the OCDS 1.1 Field Level Mapping Template to map the fields from a single table in a fictional e-GP system to OCDS. 

Step 1: Source System Details
OCDS data may originate in multiple source systems, therefore it is important to record the details of the source system we are mapping from. 
Step 2: Source Field Details
Using the (Source) Fields sheet, populate the following information for each field in the source table: the system the field is from (as recorded in step 1); the table in which the field is located; the field title.
Where additional context is required you may also record a narrative description of the source field in the description field and it might also be useful to add an example of the value that the field takes alongside further technical information on the type and multiplicity of the field.
Step 3: Mapping
The mapping template has a sheet for each stage of the contracting process, from (OCDS) 2. Planning through to (OCDS) 6. Implementation, with details of the relevant fields from the OCDS schema, in addition to the (OCDS) 1. General (all stages) sheet which contains fields relevant to all stages of the contracting process. Review each of the (OCDS) sheets in the mapping template to identify fields in the OCDS schema to which a field in the source system can be mapped. 
Step 4: Review
Repeat steps 1-3 for all tables and all source systems to complete the mapping.
Gaps in currently held data: if you identify data OCDS requests, but that you do not hold, engage with data users to consider whether this additional data could and should be provided.
Gaps in OCDS: you might have data which is not covered by OCDS. In these cases, talk with the OCDS helpdesk to see whether this should be included in an extension to the standard. Additional fields can be documented at the bottom of each mapping sheet in the template.

Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles : date and language
date: Because we want to perform automated operations like sorting on the date, we can select the Dublin Core property dcterms:date. This property can take a string value. We can indicate that the value string is formatted in accordance with the W3C Date and Time Formats specification by using syntax encoding scheme dcterms:W3CDTF.
language: The language needs to be selected from a controlled list. We achieve this by requiring the use of three-letter codes listed in the international standard ISO 639-3 for the representation of names of languages (such as ""eng"" for ""English"") together with the syntax encoding scheme dcterms:ISO639-3 as a datatype. For this, we can use the DCMI property dcterms:language, which can accommodate either an identifier for the language term or a string.

Mapping between documents and metadata in eConfidentiality system with documents and metadata in Case Management System.
N.B. Context: All documents concerning an anti-trust case are stored by case number in the case management application called "CMAfx". Documents are stored in different formats: pdf format (if available in paper form only and subsequently digitised) or word, excel, tif, rtf, html, txt version (if received as such or produced by DG Competition). CMAfx contains also procedural steps and case information, such as the composition of the case team, relevant legal basis, type of case, priority, name of undertaking concerned etc. Access to CMAfx is restricted to DG Competition personnel and national experts on secondment using DG Competition IT infrastructure. The undertakings answering the queries are obliged to indicate the confidentiality status of their responses, i.e., whether their answer must be treated as confidential, and in that case the system does not allow submission of their responses until a non-confidential answer has been provided for each confidential one. The non-confidential versions of the Commission's decisions adopted pursuant to articles 7-10, 23 and 24 of Regulation 1/2003 are published on DG Competition website, after the confidentiality claims (with regard to business secrets and other confidential information) were cleared with the respective parties.

DATA EXCHANGE STANDARDS FOR REGISTRY SYSTEMS UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL - TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
This section of the Technical Specifications addresses the messages and content requirements necessary to support submissions of unit transactions by registries and the validation of those transactions by the ITL. The unit transactions either involve the transfer of ownership of a unit, a change in an attribute of a unit, or the replacement of a tCER or lCER. This section will describe the data exchange flow, the responsibilities of registries, and the responsibilities of the ITL in order to complete a unit transaction.

The following unit transactions are described:
•	Issuance;
•	Conversion;
•	External Transfers;
•	Cancellation (Internal Transfer);
•	Replacement (Internal Transfer);
•	Retirement (Internal Transfer);
•	Carry-over; and
•	Expiry Date Change.

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
The Base Registry ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it includes "authorative sources of information", that need to be made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as "the cornerstone of European public service delivery".

The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): 

Belgian national register

The National Register refers to the information processing system which records, stores and communicates information relating to the identification of natural persons ie citizens.

It is therefore a central database in which are recorded:
•	all Belgians residing in Belgium;
•	all Belgians residing abroad who register in the population registers held in Belgian diplomatic missions or consular posts abroad;
•	all foreigners residing in Belgium who are admitted or authorized to settle or reside in the Kingdom;
•	all foreigners (and their family members) who declare themselves refugees or who are seeking recognition of refugee status.

The municipalities (and the Immigration Office for the last category of the population) are responsible for recording the information. As a pillar of e-government, the National Register ensures the sharing of authentic data identifying individuals between different public services with limited access to such data. The Sectorial Committee of the National Register established within the Commission for the Protection of Privacy is competent to authorize access to the information of the National Register or the communication thereof.

Within the Portal, sections are dedicated to:
•	Searching datasets: Categories have been established to structure the metadata harvested from the various countries. These categories follow the revision of the DCAT Application Profile and have been mapped against the Eurovoc Thesaurus.
•	Providing Data: This section gives an insight into understanding Open Data from the perspective of a data provider. In addition, instructions are offered for those who wish their data portal to be harvested by the European Data Portal.
•	Using Data: How Open Data is being used, as well as the economic benefits of Open Data are detailed in this section.
•	Training and Library: eLearning modules about Open Data as well as training guides and a knowledge base referencing publications around Open Data and featured projects.

Portals can be national, regional, local or domain specific. They cover the 28 EU Member States, EEA, countries involved in the EU's neighbourhood policy and Switzerland.

The Reference Data ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it can be shared and reused (e.g. in the form of taxonomies or controlled vocabularies) between organisation to agree on some  basic information. Management of reference data is a priority as suggested by EIF's recommendation 31: "Put in place an information management strategy at the highest possible level to avoid fragmentation and duplication. Management of metadata, master data and reference data should be prioritised."

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): 

EUROSTAT - Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) 
Principle 1: Population thresholds
The NUTS regulation defines minimum and maximum population thresholds for the size of the NUTS regions:

Level        Minimum        Maximum
NUTS 1        3 000 000        7 000 000
NUTS 2        800 000        3 000 000
NUTS 3        150 000        150 000

For administrative levels of NUTS, it is sufficient if the average size of the corresponding regions lies within the thresholds; in case of non-administrative levels, each individual region should do so. Exceptions exist however in case of geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances.
Despite the aim of ensuring that regions of comparable size all appear at the same NUTS level, each level still contains regions which differ greatly in terms of population.
Principle 2: NUTS favours administrative divisions
For practical reasons the NUTS classification generally mirrors the territorial administrative division of the Member States. This supports the availability of data and the implementation capacity of policy.
Principle 3: Regular and extraordinary amendments
The NUTS classification can be amended, but generally not more frequently than every three years. The amendments are usually based on changes of the territorial structure in one or more Member States.
In case of a substantial reorganisation of the administrative structure of a Member State, amendments to the NUTS may be adopted at intervals of less than three years. This has only happened once so far, in 2014 for Portugal.

Camunda
The core of Camunda BPM is a model execution engine that supports the OMG standards BPMN 2.0 for process automation, CMMN 1.1 for case management and DMN 1.1 for decision management.
Camunda BPM ships with a set of applications to help you model, execute and administer process applications running on the Camunda core engine. Those applications interact with the core engine's public REST API. You can also create your own applications that may also use the core engine's public Java API. It is lightweight and requires less than 3MB of disk space. It can run in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and comes with extended integration for different runtime containers.
The engine can be accessed via the REST API, or via the Java API and existing integrations with Spring and Java EE can be used. BPMN service tasks can be implemented in Java code, or the built-in REST and SOAP connectors can be used. Scripts, expressions and templates can also be applied for process implementation. Clustering for horizontal scalability is straightforward as the engine is stateless: multiple instances can share the same database.
BPMN 2.0 Processes permits the fully automated service orchestration and human workflow management.

Foreman
Foreman is an open source complete lifecycle systems management tool for provisioning, configuring and monitoring of physical and virtual servers.
It permits system administrators to easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy applications, and proactively manage servers, on premise or in the cloud.
•	Provisioning: Bare metal, Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, Libvirt, oVirt, VMware, and many other providers allow to manage a hybrid cloud through Foreman.
•	Configuration: an external node classifier, hiera-like parameters, and reports monitoring for Puppet, Salt and Chef are included. Completely ready to tweak host groups in the data centre.
•	Monitor hosts: Foreman reports tells exactly what happened in your nodes, and alerts if necessary. The dashboard shows which hosts are healthy, and which ones are outdated.

The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):
Graylog2 - open source log management platform
Graylog2 is an open source log management platform. Each message is saved in an Elasticsearch database and a web interface allows to manage and analyse the logs.
Graylog2 is divided into two parts: graylog2-server and graylog2-web-interface. The first is a Java application that accepts messages on different protocols: UDP, TCP, GELF, AMQP... Each message is analysed and saved in the Elasticsearch database. A Rest API is also integrated into the tool and is used in particular by the web-interface part. This allows to manage users, streams and dashboards. 
Some possible uses: 
•	Centralization of the logs: several types of inputs: syslog, GELF, raw... Rather than having to connect to each of the servers to consult the error logs, they can be configured to send all the messages in Graylog2.
•	Debug application
•	Exception handling
•	Log analysis
For example, it can easily list the clients who are still using the deprecated version of an API. Another search can e.g. allow you to list the largest consumers or the most used parts of an API.
Graylog Enterprise is built on top of the Graylog open source platform and offers additional features: 
•	Archiving: automatically archive the data that are not searched through very often. Store this data on more cost-effective, slower hard disks and make it available for search in Graylog only when needed.
•	Audit Log: Graylog Enterprise also offers Audit Log capabilities. Audit Log records and stores actions taken by a user or administrator that make changes in the Graylog system.

The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):
Log4j 2
Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility, part of the Apache Logging Services project of the Apache Software Foundation. 
Log4j 1.x has been widely adopted and used in many applications. However, through the years development on it has slowed down. It has become more difficult to maintain due to its need to be compliant with very old versions of Java and became End of Life in August 2015. 
Improvements in Log4j 2:
•	Log4j 2 is designed to be usable as an audit logging framework. 
•	Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency than Log4j 1.x and Logback.
•	Log4j 2 is garbage free for stand-alone applications, and low garbage for web applications during steady state logging. This reduces pressure on the garbage collector and can give better response time performance.
•	Log4j 2 uses a Plugin system that makes it extremely easy to extend the framework by adding new Appenders, Filters, Layouts, Lookups, and Pattern Converters without requiring any changes to Log4j.
•	Support for custom log levels. Custom log levels can be defined in code or in configuration.
•	Support for Message objects. Messages allow support for interesting and complex constructs to be passed through the logging system and be efficiently manipulated. 
•	Log4j 2 takes advantage of Java 5 concurrency support and performs locking at the lowest level possible. 
•	It is an Apache Software Foundation project following the community and support model used by all ASF projects.

OpenNebula
The OpenNebula monitoring subsystem gathers information relative to the hosts and the virtual machines, such as the host status, basic performance indicators, as well as VM status and capacity consumption. This information is collected by executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The information is sent according to the following process: each host periodically sends monitoring data to the front-end which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This model is highly scalable and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to the performance of the server running on and the database server.
OpenNebula also brings resource quota management to allocate, track and limit resource utilization/consumption.

ePHOENIX
epoline® PHOENIX (ePHOENIX) is a document and dossier management system designed to support the processes involved in the handling of Intellectual Property (IP)-related documents.
The system, which was developed by the European Patent Office, allows IP offices to manage application dossiers in electronic form. It provides a means for scanning all incoming documents and a user interface to display the resulting electronic dossier on screen, as well as supporting the printing and distribution of work.
ePHOENIX replaces physical paper files, thus removing the need for space-consuming archives and time-consuming transportation and management. Representing a further step towards the paperless office, the system improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness throughout the life-cycle of IP documents.
ePHOENIX is highly configurable. It provides tools and interfaces which allow existing IT systems, organisational structures, working procedures and conventions to be retained. This means minimal development costs, minimal risk and maximum user acceptance. Furthermore, it is a flexible Java-based system that can operate in a wide variety of IT architectures.
Thanks to its customisation possibilities, ePHOENIX can also be used to handle non-IP documents.
