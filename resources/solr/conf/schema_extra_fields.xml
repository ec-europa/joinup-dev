<!--
  The config generator will add dynamic fields here automatically as required by
  your individual drupal setup.

  Since search_api_solr 8.x-2.0 it's required to use dynamically generated
  config files instead copying them.

  Having these fields in a separate file is better than modifying schema.xml.
-->
Don't use the config XML templates directly. Use the config generator to get
your individual config files. Use the "Get config.zip" button in the UI or
drush solr-gsc my_solr_server
See INSTALL.md for details.
