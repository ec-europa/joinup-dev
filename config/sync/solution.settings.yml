# The array of allowed conditions for solution workflow transitions.
# Format of array:
# @code
# [
#   <target state> => [
#     <source state> => [
#       <role1>
#       <role2>
#       .
#       .
#     ]
#   ]
# ]
# @endcode
#
# The array is a three dimensions array. The first level is the
# target state the entity transits to. Each target
# state is an array of allowed source states which in every check, is the
# current state of the entity. Finally, the source states are arrays
# of roles that are allowed to perform this action.
#
# The reverse indexing here (source states
# keyed by the target state) is to follow the state_machines module logic
# of indexing states.
#
# For creating a solution, we also allow the role rdf_entity-collection-facilitator
# which we will filter in the Guard class to be the facilitator of the current
# collection. For all the other states, the solution facilitator is responsible.
# For example, a user who is a collection facilitator, can create a solution and
# put it either in draft, or in proposed state. But if he selects 'draft', then
# he can move it to a 'proposed' state only as a solution facilitator.
