# Joinup environment variables
#
# Declaring sensitive data in environment variables is an industry standard, as
# it is a very friendly mechanism for configuring the applications on different
# environments and in continuous intergartion flows, as well. Depending on the
# development environment or developer practices, the system environment
# variables can be assigned in different ways, most simple is declaring them in
# the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` files on Bash respectively Z shells. But some
# prefer to keep them inside the project's directory tree, as they are project
# specific variables. In order to do so, just copy this file as `local.env` and
# fill the sensitive values. Note that the `local.env` file is not under VCS
# control. Run the `source local.env` command to make the variables available to
# your application.
